Legal Issues: 
- The legal issues discussed include the plaintiff's alleged injuries and their severity, the credibility of the plaintiff's evidence, and the relevance of the plaintiff's financial transactions.
- The judge and the lawyers argued about the need to consider the latest MRI findings as evidence of the plaintiff's left knee injury, the inconsistency between the plaintiff's testimony and Dr. Chan's medical records regarding the recommendation of an MRI, and the plaintiff's credibility based on his inconsistent answers and suspicious financial transactions.

- The judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be not credible or helpful, citing inconsistencies with contemporaneous documents and implausible or internally contradictory answers.

- The judge noted that the plaintiff's expert had reservations about the severity of the plaintiff's alleged pain.

Rulings: 
The judge made several rulings in this case.

Another ruling was related to costs, with the judge ordering that the costs of the assessment on damages be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff, and the order nisi would become absolute unless an application to vary was made within 14 days from the date of the decision. The judge also acknowledged and thanked counsel for their assistance provided to the court.

1. Unable to pursue his hobby of cricket.
2. Difficulty in walking up and down the stairs.
3. Insomnia.
4. Feeling hopeless and useless.
5. Unhappiness and emotional distress.


Medical evidence: 
The medical evidence for the plaintiff includes the following:

1. The medical report from the Accident and Emergency Department (AED) of POH, which recorded the plaintiff's condition after the accident. It noted tenderness and abrasions in both knees and tenderness in the right hip.

2. The joint report dated 10 August 2020, prepared by Dr Wong Chin Hong for the plaintiff and Dr Wong Kwok Shing Patrick for the defendant. This report detailed their findings from a joint examination of the plaintiff on 24 July 2020.

3. The MRI report dated 17 April 2021, which was included in the plaintiff's 2nd supplemental list of documents. This report revealed a flipped lateral meniscus in the plaintiff's left knee, which was recommended for operative treatment.

4. The letter from Dr Chan dated 21 April 2021, which accompanied the MRI report and stated that the flipped meniscus in the plaintiff's left knee was likely a result of the traffic accident and recommended operative treatment.

It should be noted that the medical evidence was presented without calling the makers of the reports, and there was some reservation expressed by Dr CH Wong in the joint report regarding the plaintiff's alleged severity of pain.


Earnings of plaintiff: 
The plaintiff claimed a monthly income of around $25,000 as a full-time general labourer at a garage at the time of the accident. However, there was no corroborative documentary evidence to support this claim. The defendant's counsel argued that the plaintiff's pre-accident income was actually less than $25,000 based on bank statements. Additionally, the plaintiff claimed a loss of future earnings and a loss of earning capacity. The plaintiff hoped to find a job as a security guard, which was estimated to have a notional monthly salary of $14,380. The defendant's counsel argued that the plaintiff should be able to return to his pre-accident employment or an equivalent job before the trial and therefore should not be awarded any loss of future earnings. The court ultimately awarded a sum of $50,000 under the head of loss of earning capacity.


Quantum:
The amount of damages or compensation to be awarded to each plaintiff are as follows:

1. PSLA (Pain, Suffering, and Loss of Amenity): $100,000
2. Pre-trial loss of earnings plus MPF (Mandatory Provident Fund): $53,535
3. Loss of future earnings plus MPF: $0
4. Loss of earning capacity: $50,000
5. Special damages: $13,800

The total amount awarded to each plaintiff is $217,335.
