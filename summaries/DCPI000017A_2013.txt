Both the plaintiff's own costs and the 1st defendant's own costs, insofar as during the time when they were represented by solicitors assigned by the Director of Legal Aid, would be subject to legal aid taxation.

Accident circumstances: 
The accident involved the plaintiff injuring his back while lifting a bag of cement at the site where he was working.

However, as he was about to stand up with the bag of cement partially on his shoulder, Madam Hung suddenly withdrew her hands. This caused the plaintiff to lose his balance and fall, with his right knee landing on the ground. The plaintiff felt severe pain in his back and heard a cracking sound, which resulted in his sustaining personal injuries.
