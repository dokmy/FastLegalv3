- The defendant's witnesses testified to the existence of Jacky and explained the important role he played in the plaintiff's employment with the defendant.

Legal Issues: 
- The legal issues discussed were:
  - Whether the plaintiff was introduced to work at the site by a fellow countryman named Boota Singh or "Jacky"?
  - How the accident happened?
  - What took place immediately after the accident?
  - Whether the 1st defendant offered to pay compensation to the plaintiff in a subsequent meeting in Mongkok?

- The judge found the plaintiff to be an unreliable, evasive, and dishonest witness, and rejected his version of events regarding the introduction to work by Jacky.

- The judge did not provide a ruling on how the accident happened or what took place immediately after the accident.

- The judge did not provide a ruling on whether the 1st defendant offered to pay compensation to the plaintiff in a subsequent meeting in Mongkok.

- The judge dismissed the plaintiff's case against the 1st defendant with costs to be paid by the plaintiff on an indemnity basis. Both the plaintiff's own costs and the 1st defendant's own costs, insofar as during the time when they were represented by solicitors assigned by the Director of Legal Aid is concerned, would be subject to the legal aid taxation.


Rulings: 
The judge ruled that the plaintiff's claim against the 2nd defendant was dismissed. The judge also ruled that the plaintiff's case against the 1st defendant was dismissed with costs to be paid by the plaintiff on an indemnity basis. The judge further stated that both the plaintiff's own costs and the 1st defendant's own costs, insofar as during the time when they were represented by solicitors assigned by the Director of Legal Aid is concerned, would be subject to legal aid taxation.


injury:
Based on the given context information, there is no mention of any injuries suffered by the plaintiff, whether physical or psychological. The context only discusses the opinions of medical experts regarding the plaintiff's alleged injury, but does not provide any specific details about the injuries themselves.


Loss of amenities: 
There is no information provided in the given context regarding any loss of amenities for the plaintiff.


Medical evidence: 
Dr. Lam's opinion is that the plaintiff did not show any loss of lumbar lordosis or paraspinal muscle spasm, indicating that the pain should be of a minor degree. Dr. Wong Chin Hong, on the other hand, concluded that the plaintiff had genuine back pain and tenderness. However, the judge rejects Dr. Wong's view and agrees with Dr. Lam's assessment that the plaintiff did not suffer any serious injury. The overall medical evidence suggests that the plaintiff's injury is fairly minor and would not affect his earning capacity.


Earnings of plaintiff: 
Based on the information provided, it is stated that the plaintiff should be able to return to his previous job, even with strenuous duties. The overall effect of the alleged injury to his working ability is considered to be mild if not negligible. The plaintiff has not suffered any substantial disadvantage in the labor market or any higher chance of losing his job due to the injury. Therefore, it can be inferred that the plaintiff's income or earning abilities are not significantly affected by the alleged injury.


Quantum:
The context information does not provide any specific information about the damages or compensation to be awarded to each plaintiff.


Issues related to quantum: 
The court dismissed the plaintiff's case against the 1st defendant, finding that the plaintiff had not sustained any genuine injury in the accident and that he was an extremely dishonest and scheming person. Therefore, the court ruled in favor of the 1st defendant and dismissed the plaintiff's case.

Regarding the heads of damages, the court did not make any specific rulings or provide reasons for each head of damages since it found in favor of the 1st defendant and dismissed the plaintiff's case. Therefore, there were no awards or rulings on damages.


Costs: 
The court ruled that the plaintiff's case should be dismissed with costs to be paid by the plaintiff on an indemnity basis. Both the plaintiff's own costs and the 1st defendant's own costs, insofar as during the time when they were represented by solicitors assigned by the Director of Legal Aid, would be subject to legal aid taxation. Therefore, the plaintiff is responsible for paying the costs, and the 1st defendant was awarded costs.


Legal representation: 
The context information does not provide any information about the legal representatives or lawyers for the plaintiff or the defendants.
