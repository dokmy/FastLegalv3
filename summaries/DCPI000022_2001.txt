Judge: 
Faye McCarthy


Background of Plaintiffs: 
There is no information provided in the given context about the number of plaintiffs involved in the case, their gender, age during the accident, age during the trial or assessment of damages, or their occupation before the accident.


Background facts of case: 
- The defendant has gone into voluntary liquidation on 31 July of the current year.
- The defendant is heavily in debt, making it unlikely for the plaintiff to receive satisfaction even if they win the case.
- The defendant was represented at the beginning but could no longer make representation at the time of the trial due to lack of instructions.
- The case has become unopposed, with only the plaintiff's side of the story and claims for damages.
- The court is in a difficult situation as it should not be doing its own research and normally does not enter into the arena.
- The plaintiff received injuries and the doctor's description of the injuries and pain and suffering is considered true and accurate.
- There is doubt as to whether the accident occurred on premises occupied by the defendant and whether the defendant can be held responsible for that area.
- There might be a case of improper initial treatment that contributed to the longer healing period of the plaintiff's wound, potentially shifting some liability to someone else.
- The plaintiff claimed to have fallen because it was dark, but there might be an element of contributory negligence.
- The judge accepts the plaintiff's case on the face of it, but acknowledges that there might be legal points to query the position of liability.


Legal Issues: 
- The legal issues discussed include the defendant's voluntary liquidation, lack of representation for the defendant, unopposed action, the plaintiff's credibility, the defendant's responsibility for the accident location, potential contributory negligence, and the possibility of another party being liable for the plaintiff's injuries.
- The judge expresses doubt about the defendant's ability to satisfy any judgment due to their heavy debt.
- The judge acknowledges that the lack of opposition in the case raises problems as there is only the plaintiff's side of the story.
- The judge notes that the court should not be doing its own research and should not enter into the arena.
- The judge expresses doubt about the accident location being the defendant's premises but acknowledges the lack of solid evidence.
- The judge raises the possibility that part of the plaintiff's pain and suffering may not be directly caused by the accident and injury, suggesting that another party may be partially liable.
- The judge mentions the potential element of contributory negligence but notes that it is not in the pleadings and is left unaddressed due to the lack of opposition.
- Despite the mentioned legal issues, the judge accepts the plaintiff's case on its face and enters judgment on liability against the defendant.


Rulings: 
The judge ruled that the defendant has gone into voluntary liquidation and is heavily in debt, making it unlikely for the plaintiff to receive satisfaction from the defendant. The judge also noted that the case has become unopposed, which could raise problems as there is only the plaintiff's side of the story and no one to argue or scrutinize. The judge expressed doubt about the location of the accident and the defendant's responsibility for that area, but acknowledged the lack of solid evidence. The judge also mentioned the possibility that part of the plaintiff's pain and suffering may not be directly caused by the accident, but rather by improper treatment. The judge considered the element of contributory negligence but stated that it is not in the pleadings. Despite these observations, the judge accepted the plaintiff's case and entered judgment on liability against the defendant. Additionally, the judge allowed certain losses claimed by the plaintiff, such as taxi fares, medical bills, plane ticket, amendment charge, rail tickets, gym membership fee, and concert ticket. The judge also ruled that the plaintiff is entitled to costs of the action.

Quantum:

Issues related to quantum: 
The court ruled on two heads of damages: general damages and special damages.

For general damages, the court allowed the claim for damages to be awarded as the court sees fit. The plaintiff initially asked for $30,000, but later requested the claim to be amended without specifying a figure. The court mentioned that the plaintiff referred to several cases to support her claim, but the court found them unhelpful as they were different from the present case. Ultimately, the court allowed the claim for general damages in the amount of $70,000, stating that it had no basis to say whether it was right or wrong.

For special damages, the court allowed the claim for taxi fares in the amount of $3,000, as it considered this to be a reliable figure. The court also allowed the claim for medical bills in the amount of $15,276, stating that there could be no dispute about it.

The court did not provide specific reasons or basis for each of the heads of damages, but rather mentioned the amounts that were allowed without further explanation.
