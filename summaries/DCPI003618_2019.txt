Rulings: 
The judge made several rulings in this case. First, the judge found the defendant fully liable and assessed the plaintiff's loss and damage at a total sum of HK$455,863. The judge awarded interest on general damages for PSLA at 2% per annum from the date of the Writ to the date of the judgment, and interest on pre-trial loss of earnings and special damages at half the judgment rate of 4% per annum from the date of the accident to the date of the judgment. The judge also ruled that interest on any outstanding amount would be at the judgment rate until full payment.

Additionally, the judge ruled that the plaintiff's award (together with interest) should be deducted by the amount of Employees' Compensation the plaintiff has received. The plaintiff had received a sanctioned payment of HK$200,000 and HK$35,278. The judge also ruled that the defendant's claim of having paid the plaintiff cash in the amount of HK$25,000 and HK$35,278 was not valid. The judge further ruled that the medical expenses of HK$9,490 should not be deducted from the award. Therefore, judgment would be entered for the balance after deducting HK$235,278 from the award of HK$455,863 plus interest.

Lastly, the judge ordered costs, on a nisi basis, for the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the costs of the action. The costs were to be assessed on District Court Scale, including the costs incurred while the action was proceeding in the High Court. The plaintiff's own costs were to be taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid Regulations. This costs order nisi would become absolute after 14 days unless any party applied by summons to vary before then.

Accident circumstances: 
The accident involved the plaintiff slipping and falling in a store. According to the plaintiff's testimony, she walked out from the storeroom and her sight to the ground was blocked by a box of biscuits. Suddenly, her right foot stepped on a cart, causing her to slip and fall backwards. As she fell, the cart slipped away from her foot and toppled and bounced in the tight space of the corridor. Her buttocks hit the ground first, and while still falling, she instinctively tried to reach out her right hand to press on the floor. At this moment, amidst the confusion, she felt the side of her back and the back of her head hit the cart. This sequence of events caused the injury.
