- There were no eyewitnesses to the accident and no CCTV camera installed in the staircase.
- The defendants dispute the factual accounts put forward by the plaintiff.
- The credibility of the witnesses will be important in resolving the disputed factual accounts.

- The defendants argue that they should not be held liable for the accident and that the plaintiff's own negligence contributed to it.
- The defendants also dispute the amount of damages claimed by the plaintiff.
- The key issues agreed upon by the parties are: whether the accident occurred as alleged, whether it was caused by a wet and slippery substance on the staircase, whether each defendant was liable for the accident, whether there was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, and the quantum of damages payable to the plaintiff.


Legal Issues: 
- The legal issues discussed include the evaluation of available evidence on an objective basis, the credibility of witnesses, the application of the doctrine of res judicata, and the occurrence of the accident.
- The judge and the lawyers discussed the need to rely on objective evidence rather than self-reported feelings and symptoms, the importance of contemporaneous written documents in assessing credibility, the consistency of a witness's evidence with undisputed or indisputable evidence, and the application of the doctrine of res judicata to bar the defendant from disputing the occurrence of the accident.
- The judge ruled that the court should evaluate the available evidence objectively and give more weight to the conclusions of the experts when they are consistent with the objective evidence. The judge also ruled that the credibility of witnesses should be assessed based on contemporaneous written documents, the inherent likelihood or unlikelihood of events, and the consistency of the witness's evidence. Furthermore, the judge ruled that the doctrine of res judicata applies to bar the defendant from disputing the occurrence of the accident based on the consent judgment entered in the EC Proceedings.


Rulings: 
The judge made several rulings in the given context. First, the judge ruled that the available evidence should be evaluated on an objective basis, and placed less reliance on the self-reported feelings and symptoms of the plaintiff if they were inconsistent with the conclusions of the experts. The judge also ruled that an expert should discuss both the subjective and objective evidence in an even-handed and fair manner before coming to any conclusion. Additionally, the judge ruled that an expert should not "play advocate" by cherry-picking evidence that supports one side's case without any qualifications. Furthermore, the judge ruled that the doctrine of res judicata applies to bar D1 from disputing the occurrence of the accident in a way that is inconsistent with the consent judgment entered in the EC Proceedings.
