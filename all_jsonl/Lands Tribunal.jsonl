MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE OF THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF HONG CHIANG BUILDING", "cases_act": "LDBM241/2004", "date_in_content": "Date of Hearing: 6 th September, 2004 Date of Reasons for Decision: 14 th September, 2004 ___________________________________ REASONS FOR DECISION ___________________________________ 1. This is an application by a member of The Incorporated Owners of Hong Chiang Building (\u201cthe IO\u201d) against some other members who have been purportedly appointed as members of the management committee (the \u201cMC\u201d) of the IO.  The Applicant pleaded in its Notice of Application that the Respondents have not been validly appointed as members of the MC of the IO.  The Respondents denied the allegation in their notice of opposition. 2. This application came before me for directions on 6 th September, 2004.  I took the view that the title of the Respondents was improperly constituted and that the Respondents should be individually named and not sued as a particular management committee of the IO.  I asked the parties to express their views on this.  The solicitors for the Respondents opposed my proposal to change the title of the Respondents to the names of the individuals on the ground that such change would expose the individual Respondents personally to adverse costs orders.  It was further submitted to me that without such change, only the IO would be exposed to adverse costs orders as it was an MC of the IO that was being sued.  I did not agree with these submissions.  I now give my reasons. 3. No claim or allegation is being made against the IO itself in this application.  This application is fought between members of the IO on the validity of the election of the Respondents to the MC of the IO.  It is a battle between two groups of members of the IO.  They should thus sue and be sued in their own names.  It is wrong to sue the IO in such disputes.  It would likewise be wrong to sue the MC as a representative of the IO.  The IO should only be joined as a nominal Respondent so that it would be bound by the order to be made.  It should not play any active role either for or against this application. 4. I refer to a well established principle in company law that \u201cwhere a company is a nominal party to a petition (for winding up) but in substance the proceedings involve a dispute between shareholders, the company\u2019s money should not be spent on disputes between shareholders save for proper costs incurred, for example, on giving discovery, on an application for a validation order, and such further costs as may be expedient and necessary in the interest of the Company as a whole( Re : Crossmore Electrical and Civil Engineering Ltd . (1989) 5 BCC 37 ; Re : CG & L Investment Ltd v. Wyatt Estates Ltd . [1992] 1 HKC 78 .)\u201d(see Re: Wah Ying Cheong Company Ltd . HCCW 225/1996). 5. This principle has been acknowledged in other Hong Kong company winding up cases.  They include Re: Wyatt Estates Ltd . [1993] 1 HKLRD107, Re: Mandarin Resources Corporation Ltd . CWU 348 of 1996, Re: Ideaction Strategic Investment L td. CWU 187 of 1997 and Re: Perfect Trade Ltd . CWU 1147 of 1999. 6. This principle was discussed at length by Barma J in Re: Core Pacific-Yamaichi International (Hk) Ltd . CWU 804 of 2003: - \u201c42.    Mr Tong and Mr Graham cited to me all of the principal cases in the line of authority starting with Pickering v Stephenson (supra).  Thus, I was taken to the decisions of the English High Court in Re Kenyon Swansea Ltd [1987] BCLC 514, Re Crossmore Electrical and Civil Engineering Ltd [1989] BCLC 137, Re Hydrosan Ltd [1991] BCLC 418, Re Milgate Developments Ltd [1991] BCC 24 , Re a Company (No. 004502 of 1988) ex parte Johnson [1991] BCC 234 and Re a Company (No. 1126 of 1992) [1994] 2 BCLC 146 . I was also referred to the decision of the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in Re C G & L Investment Ltd and Wyatt Estates Ltd [1992] 1 HKC 78 . 43.     In all of those cases (with the exception of Pickering v Stephenson , which was decided well before the English equivalent of section 168A of the Ordinance was first enacted) the courts have reiterated that the nature of claims by a shareholder, whether under section 168A, or section 177(1)(f), or their English equivalents, involve only claims against the shareholder said to be in control of the company concerned, and do not involve claims against the company itself, which is a nominal party, and which should not, ordinarily, participate or expend its funds in a partisan way in those proceedings. Where such funds are so expended, that will usually involve a misfeasance on the part of those who authorised such expenditure. 44.     Although it is possible to detect differences of emphasis in the approaches of the different judges deciding the cases, I am content to adopt the views expressed by Lindsay J in Re a Company (No. 1126 of 1992) (supra) as an accurate statement of the law in this area.  In that case, Lindsay J, having reviewed all of the principal English authorities, concluded in relation to them (at 155h to 156f) that: - \u201c ... As a body they suggest to me the following. Firstly, that there may be cases (although it is unlikely nowadays when wide objects clauses are the norm) where a company\u2019s active participation in or payment of its own costs in respect of active participation in a s 459 petition as to its own affairs is ultra vires in the strict sense. Secondly, leaving aside that possible class, there is no rule that necessarily and in all cases such active participation and such expenditure is improper. Thirdly, that the test of whether such participation and expenditure is proper is whether it is necessary or expedient in the interests of the company as a whole (to borrow from Harman J in ex parte Johnson ). Fourthly, that in considering that test the court\u2019s starting point is a sort of rebuttable distaste for such participation and expenditure, initial scepticism as to its necessity or expediency.  The chorus of disapproval in the cases puts a heavy onus on a company which has actively participated or has so incurred costs to satisfy the court with evidence of the necessity or expedience in the particular case.  What will be necessary to discharge that onus will obviously vary greatly from case to case. Fifthly, if a company seeks approval by the court of such participation or expenditure in advance then, in the absence of the most compelling circumstances proven by cogent evidence, such advance approval is very unlikely. Mr Moore would have me add that such participation and expenditure should never be approved in advance, or at all, unless there is a clear demonstrable and unchallenged independence between the company and the protagonists under s 459.  Obviously, where that independence is present the task of satisfying the tests I have described is likely to be easier than in those cases where it is absent, but I am reluctant to specify that independence as either a sufficient or a necessary condition.  It is not sufficient because even truly independent board members can be swayed by partisan or other considerations they should not have entertained.  It is not necessary because even where that independence is lacking, directors, for all their lack of independence, could arrive at a true view of what was necessary or expedient in the interests of the company as a whole and might even arrive at that view for the right reasons. Finally on the law, I comment that I do not see this analysis as opening floodgates such that the courts will be swamped with applications of the kind before me.  In the vast majority of s 459 petitions there will, I think, be no real prospect of satisfying the tests I have mentioned and applications of the kind before me will be so hopeless as not even to be embarked upon.\u201d 47.     In my judgment, quite apart from questions as to the independence of the Company\u2019s board of directors, the source of its funding and its motivation for participating actively in the opposition to the Petition, it will ordinarily be inappropriate for a company which is involved in a section 168A or section 177(1)(f) petition in respect of the conduct of its affairs by a majority shareholder whose actions in that regard are under attack by a petitioner to participate actively in the proceedings either to support or to oppose them, regardless of the source of funding for such participation.  I have come to that view because it seems to me to follow from the nature of the company\u2019s position as a necessary and nominal party to such proceedings.  Given that there are no claims or allegations made against the company itself, and that the proceedings are in reality a contest between the opposing camps of shareholders, it seems to me to follow that the prosecution and defence of the proceedings is a matter that should be left to the respective camps of shareholders alone.  In ordinary civil litigation, while a party is entitled to employ as many legal representatives as he likes (in terms of the number of solicitors or counsel engaged upon his litigation), he is only entitled to one set of representation (whatever its size) in the course of the particular proceedings.  Where there are several counsel instructed for one party, the court is careful to ensure, so far as it can, that there is no overlap or repetition in the submissions made (or in rare cases, cross-examination of a witness conducted) by different counsel for the same party.  That being so, it seems to me in principle to be objectionable to permit the company, a nominal Respondent, to participate in the conduct of the petition, and thus support one side or the other, particularly in a manner involving additional and separate representation, unless there are demonstrated good reasons for it to do so.\u201d 7. I am of the view that the present application is analogous to the company winding up cases referred to above as this application is essentially a contest between members of the IO.  Hence, the funds of the corporation should not be spent to support the cause of either side.  The litigants themselves should appear as parties and bear the consequence as to costs. 8. Furthermore, it is also wrong to sue a management committee as a respondent as it is not a legal entity.  The Building Management Ordinance , Cap. 344 , has only provided a machinery for the incorporation of the owners for the time being of a building or group of buildings (s. 8).  It has not allowed the incorporation of a management committee.  There are provisions in the Ordinance to deal with matters relating to incorporation of the owners (ss. 9 to 13).  The register of the Land Registrar contains the particulars of such corporations.  The register also contains the names of some members of the management committees (s. 12(2)(d)).  It however does not contain the names of all the members of the committees.  The Land Registry also does not keep a separate registration or record of management committees.  The registration of the names of some members of committees as part of the Land Registry\u2019s record of the corporations does not thereby make the committees legal persons. 9. I also note that paragraph 5 of the 2 nd Schedule of the Ordinance stipulates how a management committee is to retire (except for a tenants\u2019 representative) at the AGM of the corporation and a new committee elected.  After this procedure has been carried out, the previous committee will be replaced by a new one.  However, it will be a new committee of the same corporation.  There are also provisions for the removal and replacement of the members of a committee (s. 14) and for the dissolution of the entire committee and the appointment of an administrator to arrange for the election of a new committee for the corporation (ss. 30 and 31).  The committee as dissolved and the new committee as elected are all committees of the same corporation.  In the winding up of a corporation, the members of the committee are treated as directors of a limited company (s. 33).  There is no procedure for the winding up of a management committee. 10. The Ordinance also imposes a duty on a corporation to manage the common parts of the building and to enforce the obligations in a deed of mutual covenant for the control, management and administration of the building.  It empowers a corporation to engage and remunerate staff as well as the chairman, vice-chairman, secretary and treasurer of the management committee (s. 18).  A management committee has to maintain proper books and accounts, but such books and accounts belong to the corporation (s. 27 and 6 th Schedule).  A corporation should also maintain an interest bearing bank account for the management of the building (s. 20(7) but not a committee.  The amount of management expenses to be paid by the owners is determined by the committee but paid to the corporation and not the committee (s. 21).  The committee is just an organ of the corporation elected by the corporation\u2019s members to exercise and perform the powers and duties of the corporation (s. 29). 11. I appreciate that section 45 of the Ordinance has included a management committee as a competent person to bring proceedings.  It is certainly competent to bring proceedings on behalf of its corporation.  I do not rule out that the possibility that a committee may bring proceedings in its own right.  However, I doubt if it is proper for a committee to sue as a legal person in its own right.  The fact that section 45 of the Building Management Ordinance , Cap. 344 has included a management committee as one of the persons who is competent to commence proceedings in the Tribunal under that section is, without more, insufficient to make the management committee a legal person. 12. For the above reasons, it is wrong to name a management committee as a Respondent as it is not a legal person which is capable of being sued.  If a claim or allegation is being made against a corporation, the corporation should be sued.  If it is only a battle between different groups of members of the corporation, the members should be named as parties.  There are of course instances like the present one where the corporation should be named as a nominal Respondent so that it would be bound by the order. 13. For the above reasons, I ordered, inter alia, the title of the respondents be amended by substituting the present title with the individual names of the members of the purported management committee which was led by Kenneth Leung Sai Wing, Yuen Moon Ting and Sandra Chan Yee Hung as its Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer respectively.

This is an application by the Applicant for compensation in respect of the property known as Shop A on Ground Floor of Nos. 7A & 7B Cross Street, Hong Kong (\u201cthe Property\u201d) which was reverted to the Government on 5 November 2005 under the Lands Resumption Ordinance , Cap. 124 (\u201cthe Ordinance\u201d) for implementation of Development Proposal H15 by the Urban Renewal Authority at Lee Tung Street / McGregor Street, Wan Chai, Hong Kong pursuant to a gazetted Government Notice G.N. No. 3739 dated 1 August 2005. 2. Immediately before the resumption, the Applicant, being the registered owner of the Property, was entitled to compensation.  Under Section 6(1)(a) of the Ordinance, the Government offered the Applicant a sum being the assessed value of the Property as assessed by the Government together with interest.  The Applicant did not accept the offer but received a sum of $8,611,000 as a provisional payment under Section 16A of the Ordinance, being the sum of the Government\u2019s assessed value of the Property together with interest thereon from the date of resumption to the date of receipt of the said sum. 3. The Applicant submitted to the Lands Tribunal on 13 September 2007 under Section 6 of the Ordinance the present application for the determination of the amount of compensation payable.  The Applicant claimed the sum of $13,500,000 as the value of the Property, together with interest and expenses, costs or remuneration referred to in Section 10(2)(e) of the Ordinance, as well as the costs of the application.  The Respondent opposed the application, denying that the claimed amount was properly assessed and the said claim was considered to be excessive. 4. By way of a consent summons, the parties filed and exchanged their respective expert reports and supplemental expert reports by 14 January 2008 and 14 March 2008 respectively.  These reports, prepared by Mr. Wayne W. K. Lee (\u201cAW\u201d) and Mr. Ng Yiu Wah, James (RW), were included in the agreed bundle, Exhibit AR-2, as follows: AW RW (i) Valuation Reports - dated 10 Jan. 2008 dated 28 Dec. 2007 (ii) Supplemental Reports - dated 12 March 2008 dated 11 March 2008 5. Both experts were called to give evidence in the hearing.  Both parties accepted AW and RW as expert witnesses.  They elaborated their valuations, produced several Exhibits and were in turn examined in chief and cross-examined.  In the final analysis, AW opined in his valuation report that the open market value (\u201cthe OMV\u201d) of the Property was, at the relevant date, in the sum of about $13,500,000.  He maintained in his supplemental report his previous opinion, save and except that his valuation would have to be amended in the light of the changes he agreed or conceded in respect of certain measurements in the Property or in the comparable properties.  On the other hand, RW opined in his supplemental report that the OMV of the Property was, at the relevant date, in the sum of $7,467,000.  This was reduced from his previous opinion of $7,926,000 as set out in his earlier valuation report.  This reduction was mainly due to the difference in the adoption of comparables by RW in his 2 valuation reports.  I will go back to this issue later below.  Therefore, although the parties had common grounds on many matters pertaining to the present valuation, there was still a difference of about 80% between the final outcome of the OMV valuations undertaken by AW and RW.  Nevertheless, the parties, through their experts, managed to resolve many differences, in particular the differences in some of the physical dimensions of the Property and the comparables. The Issues 6. The parties identified in their final written submission the following issues that would have to be determined by this Tribunal: (a) What should be the suitable method of valuation (i.e. direct comparison or term and reversion) for the Property when the expired term of the tenancy was only one month? (b) What should be the appropriate comparables? (c) What should be the appropriate quantum of adjustments for the factors of location, size, frontage, obstruction to shop front, layout and building age? (d) Finally, what should be the OMV as at 5 November 2005? Common grounds between the parties 7. In their final written submission, the parties confirmed that they had reached the following common grounds: (a) The date of valuation should be 5 November 2005. (b) The basis of valuation should be the amount which, the Property \u201cif sold by a willing seller in the open market, might be expected to realize\u201d (section 12(d) of the Ordinance). (c)  The method of valuation (subject to the issues as defined above) should be the Direct Comparison Method. (d) The particulars of the Property were agreed as follows: - (i) Situated at the ground floor of a 6-storey tenement building completed in 1974. (ii) The Property was sub-divided into three shops and leased to different tenants on monthly basis at the time of resumption. (iii) The best use of the Property was for retail purposes. (iv) For the purpose of the present proceedings, AW and RW agreed that the effective area, after adjustment for the area underneath the staircase, was 33.83 m 2 . (v) Similarly, for valuation purpose, AW and RW managed to agree on the effective areas and frontages of the comparables. (vi) AW and RW reached agreements as to the quantum of adjustments to the comparables for the factor of \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cheadroom\u201d. (vii) The adjustments that were still in dispute included: \u201clocation\u201d, \u201cobstruction to shop front\u201d, \u201csize\u201d, frontage\u201d, \u201clayout\u201d and \u201cbuilding age\u201d. The suitable method of valuation (i.e. direct comparison or term and reversion) 8. AW opined that as the three existing tenancies for various parts of the Property were all monthly tenancies, there was no need to carry out a term and reversion (to vacant possession value) valuation.  AW agreed that although the latter approach was right in principle, it was not in the circumstances practical and necessary.  The adoption of the OMV on vacant possession basis instead would also mean that there would no longer be any need to determine the various parameters used in discounting the vacant possession value and the yield in capitalizing the term interest.  Lastly, AW opined that in practice, it would be in any event usual for the vendor and purchaser to agree to allow one month or even longer for the transaction to complete.  Hence, there should not be any difference between a property that was sold on vacant possession basis or subject to a tenancy with an unexpired term of one month or less. 9. Similarly, the Applicant submitted that since the expired terms of the tenancies were all one month or less and the rent was paid in advance, it was not necessary to carry out a term and reversion valuation.  It would be more appropriate to just apply the direct comparison method on the basis of vacant possession.  The Applicant supported his submission by citing 2 previous cases in which the Lands Tribunal had adopted a similar practice in the past under similar situations: Ngai Kai-suen v Director of Lands [1994] HKDCLR 123 and Gaininn Company Limited & Another v Director of Lands (unreported, LDLR 5 and 10 of 2006).   Nevertheless, the Applicant submitted that if the Tribunal were to agree with the Respondent, the Applicant chose not to dispute the capitalization yield and the YP factor adopted by RW. 10. RW concurred with AW that the differences between the OMV of the Property on vacant possession basis and existing tenancy basis would be very small in the present case.  However, RW was of the view that the Property should be valued on existing tenancy basis as a matter of principle.  The Respondent submitted that the Applicant and his expert had not provided sufficient ground that the normal principle of valuation should not be adhered too. 11. As a matter of fact, the parties did agree that the Property was subject to three tenancies, at a total rent of $25,000 per month, inclusive of rates, as at the date of reversion. 12. Having considered the experts\u2019 opinion and the parties\u2019 submission, I agree with RW that his approach should be adopted.  Since the Respondent took the stand of not disputing the valuation parameters (apart from the estimated OMV on vacant possession basis) adopted by AW.  I will use AW\u2019s estimated valuation parameters, which are also considered to be reasonable, in the valuation set out below. The choice of the best comparables by the experts 13. I have set out in Table 1 below the best comparables adopted by the two experts (AW and RW), their unadjusted unit rates, the experts\u2019 total adjustments to the comparables and the resulting adjusted unit rates of the comparables: - Table 1 \u2013 Summary of comparables and the expert\u2019s adjusted unit rates Comparable Ref.

AW adopted 5 comparables (i.e. AC1/RC3, AC2/RC4, AC3/RC5, AC4 and AC5/RC10) as the best comparables to be used in this valuation.  They consist of 3 groups: (1) two shops at Luckifast Building, 1 Stone Nullah Lane (AC1/RC3 and AC3/RC5), (2) two shops at opposite sides of Wanchai Road (AC2/RC4 and AC4) and (2) one shop at Tai Yuen Court, 38 Tai Yuen Street (AC5/RC10).  As for the other shop comparable at Tai Yuen Street (RC9), AW opined that that should be discarded. 15. On the other hand, although RW assembled in his valuation report dated 28 December 2007 a total of 10 comparables in Wanchai, he agreed in his supplemental report to concentrate on the comparables situated to the east of Spring Garden Lane and discard the other 5 comparables located at Tai Wong Street East, Ship Street and Queen\u2019s Road East (at the junction with Ship Street).  This obviously helps to minimize the differences between the two experts in respect of the choice of comparables.  However, RW then further opined that the 2 comparables at Wanchai Road adopted by AW should be discarded whilst the larger shop comparable at Tai Yuen Street (RC9) should be adopted alongside with the other shop comparable next door. 16. In the final analysis, AW opined that the average adjusted unit rate of his best comparables was $388,248 m 2 and the RW\u2019s respective figure was $228,067 per m 2 .  Applying these to the agreed effective area of the Property at 33.83 m 2 , these give respective OMV figures, on vacant possession basis, of $13,134,430 and $7,715,507. 17. Therefore, the remaining differences between the experts as far as the very important issue of the choice of comparables were: whether or not the 2 transactions at Wanchai Road and the transaction of the larger shop at Tai Yuen Street (RC9) should be adopted.  I will consider these below. Should the Wanchai Road  transactions be adopted? 18. Although AW and RW held different views as to whether the 2 Wanchai Road comparables should be adopted for this valuation exercise, they had common ground that these 2 comparables were superior in location than the Property.  AW opined that the differences in location did not make these comparables unsuitable but it could be reflected by downward adjustment of say 20%.  On the other hand, RW opined that the differences are so great as to distinguish the comparables as inappropriate comparables for the Property.  In the event that he were asked to opine the level of differences between the comparables and the Property, RW would adopt a downward adjustment rate of 60%. 19. AW did agree with the Respondent that Wanchai Road was directly accessible by traffic while the Property was not; shops along Wanchai Road had a much wider catchment area while the Property mainly attracted local residents in the neighbourhood; Wanchai Road was wider and more accessible than Cross Street and the retail potential of the traditional Wanchai market neighbourhood was best at the junction of Cross Street and Wanchai Road.  However, although AW agreed with the Respondent that the comparables AC2/RC4 and AC4 were superior than the Property in terms of location and visibility, he disagreed that they were also much more superior in terms of retail potential. 20. Also, AW did not agree with the Respondent that retail potential dropped as one went further away from the junction with Wanchai Road.  Rather, AW opined that \u201cthe pedestrians usually live or work locally and tend to know the place quite well.  They do not mind to search the place all over in order to get the right goods or service.  Within the area, location specificity is not very important.\u201d  In addition, although AW accepted that there appeared to be higher order trades outside the local neighbourhood of Wanchai wet market area, he was of the view that \u201chigher-order trade does not mean higher profitability and hence higher ability to command a higher rent or higher property value, just as a 5-star hotel may not necessarily be more profitable than a 3-star hotel.\u201d 21. In support of his opinion that the 2 comparables at Wanchai Road were not suitable comparables, RW show in his Supplemental Report his comparison and analysis of rents of the Property and the comparables including shops at Wanchai Road, Stone Nullah Street and Tai Yuen Street.   Based on the analyzed results, he came to the conclusion that as Wanchai Road comparables clearly fetched rents at unit rates of 2.5 times to 3.7 times (depending on the year) to the unit rates of the Property. 22. AW opined that the rental analysis was flawed and meaningless for the reasons that the comparisons of rental values were made at years 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2006 between the Property and AC2/RC4 and AC4 when the rental value of the Property would have been affected by the announcement of the Scheme since around late 2003.  The Applicant also submitted that although there was no dispute that comparables AC2/RC4 and AC4 were situated at a better location than the Property, the rental analysis gave an unusual but inexplicably higher yield for the said 2 comparables.  The Applicant challenged the rental analysis carried out by RW on the ground that there was no information as to whether the existing rent passing of the Property was at market level.  Furthermore, the Applicant submitted that as even RW had agreed under cross-examination that the rental market was different from the capital market, the 2 markets might \u201cmove in different directions and/or with different paces.\u201d   Therefore, the Applicant submitted that it would be unreliable to use RW\u2019s rental analysis to come up with any meaningful conclusion. 23. I agree entirely with AW\u2019s opinion and the Applicant\u2019s submission on the un-suitability of using RW\u2019s rental analysis in this valuation exercise.  There\u2019s no point for the experts in this case to introduce the results of the rental analysis, which are subject to different interpretation. 24. However, I do not agree with AW that the differences in location of the 2 Wanchai Road comparables and the Property could be reconciled by a downward adjustment of 20%.  On the contrary, I agree with RW that the differences are so great that these 2 comparables should be discarded.  This is, in my view, also supported by the large disparity in the adjusted unit rates of these 2 comparables and those of the other comparables.  That is, from Table 1, I find that the average of AW\u2019s adjusted unit rates for these 2 comparables at Wanchai Road, at $542,318, is about 210% of the average of the adjusted unit rates for the 2 comparables at Stone Nullah Lane, or about 154% of that for AC5/RC10 at Tai Yuen Street whilst the differences between the adjusted unit rates of Stone Nullah Lane comparables and AC5/RC10 are much smaller. 25. To sum up, I concur with RW that the 2 Wanchai Road comparables should be discarded in this valuation exercise. Should the transaction of RC9 be adopted? 26. AW was of the view that RC9 was not a suitable comparable for the following 3 reasons: (i) its effective area of 84.61 m 2 is over 2.5 times that of the Property; (ii) the depth of RC9, at 12 m was almost twice as long as the Property (at 7.2 m) and (iii) the area of the yard attached to RC9, at 95.79 m 2 , was even larger than the shop proper and this disproportionate large size of the yard made the task of effective area conversion difficult. On the other hand, RW disagreed and opined that the differences in area, shop depth or the existence of a large open yard could all be accounted for by suitable adjustments the summation of which were also found to be not significant.  Therefore, the Respondent submitted that none of the said three reasons, whether taken in isolation or in total, justified AW\u2019s opinion in discarding RC9 as a suitable comparable, particularly when AW accepted the next door comparable, transacted on the same date, as one of his adopted comparables. 27. AW also opined in his Supplemental Report that the transactions of 2 comparables at Tai Yuen Street (i.e. AC5/RC10 and RC9) \u201cbear every hall mark of a single investment of an individual (purchaser)\u201d.  Therefore, AW suggested that the apparently separate transactions should be taken as one comparable instead of two so as to avoid distortion by \u201cundue exaggeration of representation\u201d by the purchase decision of an individual. 28. On the other hand, RW took the view that although the 2 transactions had a common purchaser, the vendors were different.  The Respondent further submitted that as confirmed by AW while giving evidence in the Tribunal, there was no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the two vendors were connected in any way.  As such, the Respondent disagreed to discard this comparable.  Using a similar argument as propounded by RW, the Respondent submitted that to disregard the transaction of RC9 (which was \u201ccheaper\u201d in terms of unit rate when compared with that of AC5/RC10) would actually distort the result of the analysis of the so-called \u201csingle transaction\u201d by the common purchaser and in turn the present valuation. 29. Having considered the evidence and the submission for these 2 transactions, I concur with RW that there is insufficient ground to discard the transaction of comparable RC9.  As revealed by the description of the comparable and the registered floor plan, the property actually consists of 2 shops in the building of Tai Yuen Court.  Therefore, it appears to me that the adjustment for differences in the size of the comparable and that of the Property somewhat amounts to the quantum adjustment one would allow for when considering the transaction prices and values of one or two shops.  I have raised this question in the hearing but both experts did not see fit to take this into consideration in their valuation.  To conclude, I agree with RW and am satisfied that the physical differences between RC9 and the Property could be dealt with by adjustments in the usual manner. Adoption of the best comparables by the Tribunal 30. To summarize, I decide for reasons set out above that the best comparables for the present valuation exercise should be AC1/RC3, AC3/RC5, AC5/RC10 and RC9. Adjustments of the comparables by the Tribunal 31. I have also summarized below the adjustments I consider to be appropriate for the 5 adopted comparables: - Table 2 \u2013 Adjustments of comparables adopted by the Tribunal Comparable Ref. AC1 / RC3 AC3 / RC5 AC5 / RC10 - / RC9 Unadjusted Unit Rate $255,871 $149,074 $226,519 $192,649 Time 5.4% 1.1% 4% 4% Location -10% -10% 5% 5% Obstruction to Shop front -10% -10% 5% 5% Size -1.1% 1.6% 0.5% 10.2% Frontage 18.8% 17.6% 15.1% 2.4% Layout 0 5% 5% 0 Headroom 5.1% 5.1% 0.9% 0.9% Bldg.

I have noted and accepted the experts\u2019 agreements on the adjustments for time and headroom.  I will consider below the differences in adjustments by AW and RW for the other factors in respect of all or some comparables. Location 33. The experts agreed on the level of adjustments for AC1/RC3 and AC3/RC5 while they had differences in the adjustments for the shops at Tai Yuen Street (AC5/RC10 and RC9).  I agree that the Property was superior in location to the latter 2 comparables but not to the extent as opined by AW.  I adopt the same +5% for both comparables. Obstruction to shop front 34. Both experts agreed that the 2 comparables at Stone Nullah Street (AC1/RC3 and AC3/RC5) were superior to the Property as they were not obstructed by the on-street licensed hawker stalls.  AW and RW opined adjustments of -8% and -10% respectively for both comparables.  I adopt RW\u2019s opinion of -10% adjustment.  As for the 2 adjoining comparables at Tai Yuen Street (AC5/RC10 and RC9), RW opined that there should not be any difference whilst AW suggested an adjustment of +6% for AC5/RC10.  I agree with AW that there appeared to be less obstruction at the Property.  Hence, I adopt an adjustment of +5% for both comparables at Tai Yuen Street. Size 35. The experts had agreements on the adjustments for the 2 comparables at Stone Nullah Street and the common comparable at Tai Yuen Street.  As for RC9, I note that RW gave an adjustment of 10.2%.  Indeed, as discussed above, it consisted of 2 shops (Shops E & F) of the building Tai Yuen Court at 38 Tai Yuen St.  As I find RW\u2019s proposed adjustment to be reasonable, I adopt his figure. Frontage 36. This is the only factor of adjustment that the 2 experts differed to a large extent.  The parties\u2019 position are summarized below: AC1/RC3 AC3/RC5 AC5/RC10 -/RC9 Applicant 33.6% (2.23 m) 32.7% (2.48 m) 30.7% (3.06 m) - Respondent 18.8% (2.10 m) 17.6% (2.40 m) 15.1% (3.02 m) 2.4% (6.2 m) 37. As summed up by the Respondent in the Final Written Submission, the large differences in the parties\u2019 estimates were caused by the following: (a)     Disagreement as to whether the thickness of the walls and columns ought to be included in measuring the frontage of both the Property and the comparables; (b)    Disagreement as to whether the toilet wall and the wall adjoining the toilet wall ought to be included as the frontage; (c)    AW allowed an adjustment of 3.5% for every 1 m difference in frontage while RW\u2019s corresponding adjustment was 4% (hence their differences in this respect was relatively minor); (d)    Disagreement as to whether the general rule applies to the side frontage along Sam Pan Street. 38. Firstly, I agree with RW that the thickness of wall and column should not be included as the dimension of the shop frontage.  I believe that it is just sheer common sense that the linear dimension of a shop\u2019s open frontage has a much greater bearing on the value of the shop than the dimension of the end wall or column.  Next, as to the adjustment for the secondary return frontage of Sam Pan Street of the Property, I concur with RW that a ballpark figure but not the general straight-line approach should be applied.  This is because I agree that Sam Pan Street was much inferior to Cross Street in terms of attraction and pedestrian flow at the date of reversion.   For this reason, there is no longer any need to decide whether the toilet wall and the wall next to it at Sam Pan Street should be treated in full as the rest of the frontages at Sam Pan Street and Cross Street. 39. To conclude, I agree with RW in his adjustments for the factor of frontage for all 4 comparables. Layout 40. The experts agreed that no adjustment was required for AC1/RC3 and RC9.  AW opined that an adjustment of +5% be applied to AC3/RC5 and AC5/RC10 while RW suggested that these were unnecessary.  I agree with AW\u2019s opinion for these 2 comparables. Building Age 41. I agree with RW that no adjustment to the comparables for this factor of adjustment is required. Valuation of the OMV of the Property on vacant possession basis 42. Applying the average of the adjusted unit rates of the adopted 4 comparables, in the amount of $248,498 per sq. m. as set out in Table 2 above to the agreed effective area of the Property at 33. 83 sq. m. gives the OMV of the Property, on vacant possession basis, as $8,406,687, which is rounded to $8,410,000. Valuation of the OMV of the Property subject to tenancies 43. Adopting the methodology and valuation parameters of RW as set out in Exh.

Cheung, Chan & Chung, for the Applicant. Mr. Simon K. C. LAM, instructed by the Department of Justice, for the Respondent.", "coram": "Dates of Hearing: 7, 10 - 12 November 2008 Date of Judgment: 11 December 2008 ________________ J U D G M E N T ________________ Background 1. This is an application by the Applicant for compensation in respect of the property known as Shop A on Ground Floor of Nos. 7A & 7B Cross Street, Hong Kong (\u201cthe Property\u201d) which was reverted to the Government on 5 November 2005 under the Lands Resumption Ordinance , Cap. 124 (\u201cthe Ordinance\u201d) for implementation of Development Proposal H15 by the Urban Renewal Authority at Lee Tung Street / McGregor Street, Wan Chai, Hong Kong pursuant to a gazetted Government Notice G.N. No. 3739 dated 1 August 2005. 2. Immediately before the resumption, the Applicant, being the registered owner of the Property, was entitled to compensation.  Under Section 6(1)(a) of the Ordinance, the Government offered the Applicant a sum being the assessed value of the Property as assessed by the Government together with interest.  The Applicant did not accept the offer but received a sum of $8,611,000 as a provisional payment under Section 16A of the Ordinance, being the sum of the Government\u2019s assessed value of the Property together with interest thereon from the date of resumption to the date of receipt of the said sum. 3. The Applicant submitted to the Lands Tribunal on 13 September 2007 under Section 6 of the Ordinance the present application for the determination of the amount of compensation payable.  The Applicant claimed the sum of $13,500,000 as the value of the Property, together with interest and expenses, costs or remuneration referred to in Section 10(2)(e) of the Ordinance, as well as the costs of the application.  The Respondent opposed the application, denying that the claimed amount was properly assessed and the said claim was considered to be excessive. 4. By way of a consent summons, the parties filed and exchanged their respective expert reports and supplemental expert reports by 14 January 2008 and 14 March 2008 respectively.  These reports, prepared by Mr. Wayne W. K. Lee (\u201cAW\u201d) and Mr. Ng Yiu Wah, James (RW), were included in the agreed bundle, Exhibit AR-2, as follows: AW RW (i) Valuation Reports - dated 10 Jan. 2008 dated 28 Dec. 2007 (ii) Supplemental Reports - dated 12 March 2008 dated 11 March 2008 5. Both experts were called to give evidence in the hearing.  Both parties accepted AW and RW as expert witnesses.  They elaborated their valuations, produced several Exhibits and were in turn examined in chief and cross-examined.  In the final analysis, AW opined in his valuation report that the open market value (\u201cthe OMV\u201d) of the Property was, at the relevant date, in the sum of about $13,500,000.  He maintained in his supplemental report his previous opinion, save and except that his valuation would have to be amended in the light of the changes he agreed or conceded in respect of certain measurements in the Property or in the comparable properties.  On the other hand, RW opined in his supplemental report that the OMV of the Property was, at the relevant date, in the sum of $7,467,000.  This was reduced from his previous opinion of $7,926,000 as set out in his earlier valuation report.  This reduction was mainly due to the difference in the adoption of comparables by RW in his 2 valuation reports.  I will go back to this issue later below.  Therefore, although the parties had common grounds on many matters pertaining to the present valuation, there was still a difference of about 80% between the final outcome of the OMV valuations undertaken by AW and RW.  Nevertheless, the parties, through their experts, managed to resolve many differences, in particular the differences in some of the physical dimensions of the Property and the comparables. The Issues 6. The parties identified in their final written submission the following issues that would have to be determined by this Tribunal: (a) What should be the suitable method of valuation (i.e. direct comparison or term and reversion) for the Property when the expired term of the tenancy was only one month? (b) What should be the appropriate comparables? (c) What should be the appropriate quantum of adjustments for the factors of location, size, frontage, obstruction to shop front, layout and building age? (d) Finally, what should be the OMV as at 5 November 2005? Common grounds between the parties 7. In their final written submission, the parties confirmed that they had reached the following common grounds: (a) The date of valuation should be 5 November 2005. (b) The basis of valuation should be the amount which, the Property \u201cif sold by a willing seller in the open market, might be expected to realize\u201d (section 12(d) of the Ordinance). (c)  The method of valuation (subject to the issues as defined above) should be the Direct Comparison Method. (d) The particulars of the Property were agreed as follows: - (i) Situated at the ground floor of a 6-storey tenement building completed in 1974. (ii) The Property was sub-divided into three shops and leased to different tenants on monthly basis at the time of resumption. (iii) The best use of the Property was for retail purposes. (iv) For the purpose of the present proceedings, AW and RW agreed that the effective area, after adjustment for the area underneath the staircase, was 33.83 m 2 . (v) Similarly, for valuation purpose, AW and RW managed to agree on the effective areas and frontages of the comparables. (vi) AW and RW reached agreements as to the quantum of adjustments to the comparables for the factor of \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cheadroom\u201d. (vii) The adjustments that were still in dispute included: \u201clocation\u201d, \u201cobstruction to shop front\u201d, \u201csize\u201d, frontage\u201d, \u201clayout\u201d and \u201cbuilding age\u201d. The suitable method of valuation (i.e. direct comparison or term and reversion) 8. AW opined that as the three existing tenancies for various parts of the Property were all monthly tenancies, there was no need to carry out a term and reversion (to vacant possession value) valuation.  AW agreed that although the latter approach was right in principle, it was not in the circumstances practical and necessary.  The adoption of the OMV on vacant possession basis instead would also mean that there would no longer be any need to determine the various parameters used in discounting the vacant possession value and the yield in capitalizing the term interest.  Lastly, AW opined that in practice, it would be in any event usual for the vendor and purchaser to agree to allow one month or even longer for the transaction to complete.  Hence, there should not be any difference between a property that was sold on vacant possession basis or subject to a tenancy with an unexpired term of one month or less. 9. Similarly, the Applicant submitted that since the expired terms of the tenancies were all one month or less and the rent was paid in advance, it was not necessary to carry out a term and reversion valuation.  It would be more appropriate to just apply the direct comparison method on the basis of vacant possession.  The Applicant supported his submission by citing 2 previous cases in which the Lands Tribunal had adopted a similar practice in the past under similar situations: Ngai Kai-suen v Director of Lands [1994] HKDCLR 123 and Gaininn Company Limited & Another v Director of Lands (unreported, LDLR 5 and 10 of 2006).   Nevertheless, the Applicant submitted that if the Tribunal were to agree with the Respondent, the Applicant chose not to dispute the capitalization yield and the YP factor adopted by RW. 10. RW concurred with AW that the differences between the OMV of the Property on vacant possession basis and existing tenancy basis would be very small in the present case.  However, RW was of the view that the Property should be valued on existing tenancy basis as a matter of principle.  The Respondent submitted that the Applicant and his expert had not provided sufficient ground that the normal principle of valuation should not be adhered too. 11. As a matter of fact, the parties did agree that the Property was subject to three tenancies, at a total rent of $25,000 per month, inclusive of rates, as at the date of reversion. 12. Having considered the experts\u2019 opinion and the parties\u2019 submission, I agree with RW that his approach should be adopted.  Since the Respondent took the stand of not disputing the valuation parameters (apart from the estimated OMV on vacant possession basis) adopted by AW.  I will use AW\u2019s estimated valuation parameters, which are also considered to be reasonable, in the valuation set out below. The choice of the best comparables by the experts 13. I have set out in Table 1 below the best comparables adopted by the two experts (AW and RW), their unadjusted unit rates, the experts\u2019 total adjustments to the comparables and the resulting adjusted unit rates of the comparables: - Table 1 \u2013 Summary of comparables and the expert\u2019s adjusted unit rates Comparable Ref.

AW adopted 5 comparables (i.e. AC1/RC3, AC2/RC4, AC3/RC5, AC4 and AC5/RC10) as the best comparables to be used in this valuation.  They consist of 3 groups: (1) two shops at Luckifast Building, 1 Stone Nullah Lane (AC1/RC3 and AC3/RC5), (2) two shops at opposite sides of Wanchai Road (AC2/RC4 and AC4) and (2) one shop at Tai Yuen Court, 38 Tai Yuen Street (AC5/RC10).  As for the other shop comparable at Tai Yuen Street (RC9), AW opined that that should be discarded. 15. On the other hand, although RW assembled in his valuation report dated 28 December 2007 a total of 10 comparables in Wanchai, he agreed in his supplemental report to concentrate on the comparables situated to the east of Spring Garden Lane and discard the other 5 comparables located at Tai Wong Street East, Ship Street and Queen\u2019s Road East (at the junction with Ship Street).  This obviously helps to minimize the differences between the two experts in respect of the choice of comparables.  However, RW then further opined that the 2 comparables at Wanchai Road adopted by AW should be discarded whilst the larger shop comparable at Tai Yuen Street (RC9) should be adopted alongside with the other shop comparable next door. 16. In the final analysis, AW opined that the average adjusted unit rate of his best comparables was $388,248 m 2 and the RW\u2019s respective figure was $228,067 per m 2 .  Applying these to the agreed effective area of the Property at 33.83 m 2 , these give respective OMV figures, on vacant possession basis, of $13,134,430 and $7,715,507. 17. Therefore, the remaining differences between the experts as far as the very important issue of the choice of comparables were: whether or not the 2 transactions at Wanchai Road and the transaction of the larger shop at Tai Yuen Street (RC9) should be adopted.  I will consider these below. Should the Wanchai Road  transactions be adopted? 18. Although AW and RW held different views as to whether the 2 Wanchai Road comparables should be adopted for this valuation exercise, they had common ground that these 2 comparables were superior in location than the Property.  AW opined that the differences in location did not make these comparables unsuitable but it could be reflected by downward adjustment of say 20%.  On the other hand, RW opined that the differences are so great as to distinguish the comparables as inappropriate comparables for the Property.  In the event that he were asked to opine the level of differences between the comparables and the Property, RW would adopt a downward adjustment rate of 60%. 19. AW did agree with the Respondent that Wanchai Road was directly accessible by traffic while the Property was not; shops along Wanchai Road had a much wider catchment area while the Property mainly attracted local residents in the neighbourhood; Wanchai Road was wider and more accessible than Cross Street and the retail potential of the traditional Wanchai market neighbourhood was best at the junction of Cross Street and Wanchai Road.  However, although AW agreed with the Respondent that the comparables AC2/RC4 and AC4 were superior than the Property in terms of location and visibility, he disagreed that they were also much more superior in terms of retail potential. 20. Also, AW did not agree with the Respondent that retail potential dropped as one went further away from the junction with Wanchai Road.  Rather, AW opined that \u201cthe pedestrians usually live or work locally and tend to know the place quite well.  They do not mind to search the place all over in order to get the right goods or service.  Within the area, location specificity is not very important.\u201d  In addition, although AW accepted that there appeared to be higher order trades outside the local neighbourhood of Wanchai wet market area, he was of the view that \u201chigher-order trade does not mean higher profitability and hence higher ability to command a higher rent or higher property value, just as a 5-star hotel may not necessarily be more profitable than a 3-star hotel.\u201d 21. In support of his opinion that the 2 comparables at Wanchai Road were not suitable comparables, RW show in his Supplemental Report his comparison and analysis of rents of the Property and the comparables including shops at Wanchai Road, Stone Nullah Street and Tai Yuen Street.   Based on the analyzed results, he came to the conclusion that as Wanchai Road comparables clearly fetched rents at unit rates of 2.5 times to 3.7 times (depending on the year) to the unit rates of the Property. 22. AW opined that the rental analysis was flawed and meaningless for the reasons that the comparisons of rental values were made at years 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2006 between the Property and AC2/RC4 and AC4 when the rental value of the Property would have been affected by the announcement of the Scheme since around late 2003.  The Applicant also submitted that although there was no dispute that comparables AC2/RC4 and AC4 were situated at a better location than the Property, the rental analysis gave an unusual but inexplicably higher yield for the said 2 comparables.  The Applicant challenged the rental analysis carried out by RW on the ground that there was no information as to whether the existing rent passing of the Property was at market level.  Furthermore, the Applicant submitted that as even RW had agreed under cross-examination that the rental market was different from the capital market, the 2 markets might \u201cmove in different directions and/or with different paces.\u201d   Therefore, the Applicant submitted that it would be unreliable to use RW\u2019s rental analysis to come up with any meaningful conclusion. 23. I agree entirely with AW\u2019s opinion and the Applicant\u2019s submission on the un-suitability of using RW\u2019s rental analysis in this valuation exercise.  There\u2019s no point for the experts in this case to introduce the results of the rental analysis, which are subject to different interpretation. 24. However, I do not agree with AW that the differences in location of the 2 Wanchai Road comparables and the Property could be reconciled by a downward adjustment of 20%.  On the contrary, I agree with RW that the differences are so great that these 2 comparables should be discarded.  This is, in my view, also supported by the large disparity in the adjusted unit rates of these 2 comparables and those of the other comparables.  That is, from Table 1, I find that the average of AW\u2019s adjusted unit rates for these 2 comparables at Wanchai Road, at $542,318, is about 210% of the average of the adjusted unit rates for the 2 comparables at Stone Nullah Lane, or about 154% of that for AC5/RC10 at Tai Yuen Street whilst the differences between the adjusted unit rates of Stone Nullah Lane comparables and AC5/RC10 are much smaller. 25. To sum up, I concur with RW that the 2 Wanchai Road comparables should be discarded in this valuation exercise. Should the transaction of RC9 be adopted? 26. AW was of the view that RC9 was not a suitable comparable for the following 3 reasons: (i) its effective area of 84.61 m 2 is over 2.5 times that of the Property; (ii) the depth of RC9, at 12 m was almost twice as long as the Property (at 7.2 m) and (iii) the area of the yard attached to RC9, at 95.79 m 2 , was even larger than the shop proper and this disproportionate large size of the yard made the task of effective area conversion difficult. On the other hand, RW disagreed and opined that the differences in area, shop depth or the existence of a large open yard could all be accounted for by suitable adjustments the summation of which were also found to be not significant.  Therefore, the Respondent submitted that none of the said three reasons, whether taken in isolation or in total, justified AW\u2019s opinion in discarding RC9 as a suitable comparable, particularly when AW accepted the next door comparable, transacted on the same date, as one of his adopted comparables. 27. AW also opined in his Supplemental Report that the transactions of 2 comparables at Tai Yuen Street (i.e. AC5/RC10 and RC9) \u201cbear every hall mark of a single investment of an individual (purchaser)\u201d.  Therefore, AW suggested that the apparently separate transactions should be taken as one comparable instead of two so as to avoid distortion by \u201cundue exaggeration of representation\u201d by the purchase decision of an individual. 28. On the other hand, RW took the view that although the 2 transactions had a common purchaser, the vendors were different.  The Respondent further submitted that as confirmed by AW while giving evidence in the Tribunal, there was no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the two vendors were connected in any way.  As such, the Respondent disagreed to discard this comparable.  Using a similar argument as propounded by RW, the Respondent submitted that to disregard the transaction of RC9 (which was \u201ccheaper\u201d in terms of unit rate when compared with that of AC5/RC10) would actually distort the result of the analysis of the so-called \u201csingle transaction\u201d by the common purchaser and in turn the present valuation. 29. Having considered the evidence and the submission for these 2 transactions, I concur with RW that there is insufficient ground to discard the transaction of comparable RC9.  As revealed by the description of the comparable and the registered floor plan, the property actually consists of 2 shops in the building of Tai Yuen Court.  Therefore, it appears to me that the adjustment for differences in the size of the comparable and that of the Property somewhat amounts to the quantum adjustment one would allow for when considering the transaction prices and values of one or two shops.  I have raised this question in the hearing but both experts did not see fit to take this into consideration in their valuation.  To conclude, I agree with RW and am satisfied that the physical differences between RC9 and the Property could be dealt with by adjustments in the usual manner. Adoption of the best comparables by the Tribunal 30. To summarize, I decide for reasons set out above that the best comparables for the present valuation exercise should be AC1/RC3, AC3/RC5, AC5/RC10 and RC9. Adjustments of the comparables by the Tribunal 31. I have also summarized below the adjustments I consider to be appropriate for the 5 adopted comparables: - Table 2 \u2013 Adjustments of comparables adopted by the Tribunal Comparable Ref. AC1 / RC3 AC3 / RC5 AC5 / RC10 - / RC9 Unadjusted Unit Rate $255,871 $149,074 $226,519 $192,649 Time 5.4% 1.1% 4% 4% Location -10% -10% 5% 5% Obstruction to Shop front -10% -10% 5% 5% Size -1.1% 1.6% 0.5% 10.2% Frontage 18.8% 17.6% 15.1% 2.4% Layout 0 5% 5% 0 Headroom 5.1% 5.1% 0.9% 0.9% Bldg.

I have noted and accepted the experts\u2019 agreements on the adjustments for time and headroom.  I will consider below the differences in adjustments by AW and RW for the other factors in respect of all or some comparables. Location 33. The experts agreed on the level of adjustments for AC1/RC3 and AC3/RC5 while they had differences in the adjustments for the shops at Tai Yuen Street (AC5/RC10 and RC9).  I agree that the Property was superior in location to the latter 2 comparables but not to the extent as opined by AW.  I adopt the same +5% for both comparables. Obstruction to shop front 34. Both experts agreed that the 2 comparables at Stone Nullah Street (AC1/RC3 and AC3/RC5) were superior to the Property as they were not obstructed by the on-street licensed hawker stalls.  AW and RW opined adjustments of -8% and -10% respectively for both comparables.  I adopt RW\u2019s opinion of -10% adjustment.  As for the 2 adjoining comparables at Tai Yuen Street (AC5/RC10 and RC9), RW opined that there should not be any difference whilst AW suggested an adjustment of +6% for AC5/RC10.  I agree with AW that there appeared to be less obstruction at the Property.  Hence, I adopt an adjustment of +5% for both comparables at Tai Yuen Street. Size 35. The experts had agreements on the adjustments for the 2 comparables at Stone Nullah Street and the common comparable at Tai Yuen Street.  As for RC9, I note that RW gave an adjustment of 10.2%.  Indeed, as discussed above, it consisted of 2 shops (Shops E & F) of the building Tai Yuen Court at 38 Tai Yuen St.  As I find RW\u2019s proposed adjustment to be reasonable, I adopt his figure. Frontage 36. This is the only factor of adjustment that the 2 experts differed to a large extent.  The parties\u2019 position are summarized below: AC1/RC3 AC3/RC5 AC5/RC10 -/RC9 Applicant 33.6% (2.23 m) 32.7% (2.48 m) 30.7% (3.06 m) - Respondent 18.8% (2.10 m) 17.6% (2.40 m) 15.1% (3.02 m) 2.4% (6.2 m) 37. As summed up by the Respondent in the Final Written Submission, the large differences in the parties\u2019 estimates were caused by the following: (a)     Disagreement as to whether the thickness of the walls and columns ought to be included in measuring the frontage of both the Property and the comparables; (b)    Disagreement as to whether the toilet wall and the wall adjoining the toilet wall ought to be included as the frontage; (c)    AW allowed an adjustment of 3.5% for every 1 m difference in frontage while RW\u2019s corresponding adjustment was 4% (hence their differences in this respect was relatively minor); (d)    Disagreement as to whether the general rule applies to the side frontage along Sam Pan Street. 38. Firstly, I agree with RW that the thickness of wall and column should not be included as the dimension of the shop frontage.  I believe that it is just sheer common sense that the linear dimension of a shop\u2019s open frontage has a much greater bearing on the value of the shop than the dimension of the end wall or column.  Next, as to the adjustment for the secondary return frontage of Sam Pan Street of the Property, I concur with RW that a ballpark figure but not the general straight-line approach should be applied.  This is because I agree that Sam Pan Street was much inferior to Cross Street in terms of attraction and pedestrian flow at the date of reversion.   For this reason, there is no longer any need to decide whether the toilet wall and the wall next to it at Sam Pan Street should be treated in full as the rest of the frontages at Sam Pan Street and Cross Street. 39. To conclude, I agree with RW in his adjustments for the factor of frontage for all 4 comparables. Layout 40. The experts agreed that no adjustment was required for AC1/RC3 and RC9.  AW opined that an adjustment of +5% be applied to AC3/RC5 and AC5/RC10 while RW suggested that these were unnecessary.  I agree with AW\u2019s opinion for these 2 comparables. Building Age 41. I agree with RW that no adjustment to the comparables for this factor of adjustment is required. Valuation of the OMV of the Property on vacant possession basis 42. Applying the average of the adjusted unit rates of the adopted 4 comparables, in the amount of $248,498 per sq. m. as set out in Table 2 above to the agreed effective area of the Property at 33. 83 sq. m. gives the OMV of the Property, on vacant possession basis, as $8,406,687, which is rounded to $8,410,000. Valuation of the OMV of the Property subject to tenancies 43. Adopting the methodology and valuation parameters of RW as set out in Exh. R7, the OMV of the Property subject to tenancies is estimated as follows: Existing total rent per month $25,000 x 12 Yearly rent $300,000 Less rates at 5% of $276,000 $13,800 Net yearly rent $286,200 YP 1 month at 4% 0.08160 Value of the term $23,354 Reversionary to OMV $8,410,000 PV 1 month at 5% 0.9959 $8,375,519 Estimated OMV of the Property subject to tenancies $8,398,973 Rounded to $8,400,000 Orders 44. Accordingly, I order that the Respondent do pay the Applicant compensation for the Property in the sum of $8,400,000.  The matters of professional fees, interest and costs shall be reserved, with liberty to apply by either party. (Mr. W. K. LO) Member, Lands Tribunal Mr. Simon K. M. LUI, instructed by Messrs.

The 1 st and 2 nd Applicants in LDBM 243/2005, namely Mr Lung Po Kwan (\u201cMr Lung\u201d) and Ms Lee Karen Yuk Lun (\u201cMs Lee\u201d) are the registered owners of Car Park No. 27 (\u201cCP27\u201d) on the Lower Carport, Y.Y. Mansion (\u201cthe Building\u201d), 96 Pok Fu Lam Road, Hong Kong.  The 1 st Respondent in LDBM 243/2005, namely Ms Tang Kam Sheung (\u201cMs Tang\u201d) is the registered owner of Car Park No. 25 (\u201cCP25\u201d) on the Lower Carport of the Building.  The 2 nd Respondent in LDBM 243/2005, namely the Incorporated Owners of Y.Y. Mansion (\u201cthe IO\u201d), is the owners\u2019 corporation of the Building.  Ms Tang is also the Applicant in LDBM 305/2005 and the IO is the Respondent in LDBM 305/2005.  LDBM 243/2005 and LDBM 309/2005 are tried together as they involve the same material issue, namely the liability of Ms Tang and/or the IO in causing obstruction of the passageway to and from CP27 by vehicle parked at CP25. 2. There are not many factual issues in dispute in these 2 cases.  The Building was developed by Yue Yan Investment Company (\u201cthe Developer\u201d) and the occupation permit was issued on 26 January 1967.  The Building has 4 residential blocks, namely Blocks A, B, C and D, and 3 levels of car parks, namely the Lower Carport, the Middle Carport and the Upper Carport.  The IO was incorporated in 1971 and became the manager of the Building since then. 3. During the period from March 1995 to November 1995, the Building had a large-scale renovation.  One of the works involved was to re-align the boundaries of the car parks in the Building in accordance with the approved car parking lay out plan registered in the Land Registry (\u201cthe Approved Plan\u201d).  Before the renovation, the boundaries of the car parks were not marked according to the Approved Plan, and this was a clear breach of the terms of the government grant. 4. However, in re-aligning the boundaries of the car parks, the architect responsible for the renovation discovered that the existing wall at the rear part of the Lower Carport (\u201cthe Wall\u201d) was built in a position that cut across the rear portion of CP25, rendering about one third of the area of CP25 hidden behind the Wall.  The Wall is not shown in the Approved Plan but has been in existence since about 1968.  There is no evidence as to who built the Wall or when exactly it was built. 5. As a result of the re-alignment, the usable area of CP25 is reduced substantially and Ms Tang cannot park her van at CP25 without protruding the front of her van from the boundary of CP25. 6. Mr Lung and Ms Lee became the registered owners of CP27 in April 1997.  Since then, Mr Lung has difficulty in parking his car at CP27, which is adjacent to CP25, because Ms Tang\u2019s van is obstructing the passageway to and from CP27.  It is not disputed that the passageway is part of the common part of the Building. 7. After many attempts to resolve the dispute amicably, the parties failed to reach a solution acceptable to all of them.  Thus, the matter came to the Lands Tribunal for determination. 8. In LDBM 243/2005, Mr Lung and Ms Lee are claiming for an injunction against Ms Tang that she be restrained from parking a vehicle at CP25 in such a manner that obstructs the passageway to and from CP27, as well as damages for obstructing the exclusive right to peaceful and quiet enjoyment of CP27.  They also claim against the IO for an order that the IO do carry out such action as necessary in order to prevent Ms Tang from parking a vehicle at CP25 in such a manner that obstructs the passageway to and from CP27, as well as for damages in failing to do so. 9. In LDBM 309/2005, Ms Tang is claiming against the IO for an order that the IO do re-modify the boundary of CP25 so that it matches the size as reflected in the Approved Plan, and for damages to be assessed. 10. In addition, Ms Tang also seeks for the following reliefs in LDBM 243/2005 :- (a) a declaration that the IO is not entitled to trespass on CP25; (b) an injunction to restrain the IO from interfering with Ms Tang\u2019s possession, use and enjoyment of CP25; (c) a declaration that Ms Tang is not responsible for the obstructions (if any) caused to the passageway of CP27; (d) (i)   an order that the IO do re-mark the car parks within 6 months so that the length and width of CP25 resemble that as described in the Lower Carport Plan annexed to the Deed of Mutual Covenant of the Building (\u201cthe DMC\u201d); (d) (ii)   an order for the IO to remove all objects erected in the Lower Carport that would interfere with the reasonable use of the car park spaces including and surrounding CP25 and to reinstate a passageway of not less than 7 feet in width for the car park spaces within the Lower Carport; (e) a mandatory injunction for the IO to remove all objects erected on CP25 within 6 months; (f) damages in the sum of $1,442,000 being a sum representing the decrease in value of Ms Tang\u2019s property due to the IO\u2019s trespass; and (g) interests. 11. It is rather unusual for a respondent to make a claim against another respondent in the same action without taking out any Third Party Proceedings.  However, as Ms Tang has already made a claim against the IO in LDBM 309/2005, and these 2 cases are tried together, I will treat these additional claims as the other remedies sought by Ms Tang in LDBM 309/2005.  There is also no Notice of Opposition filed by the IO in LDBM 309/2005, but the IO has raised their defence to Ms Tang\u2019s claims in the Amended Notice of Opposition filed in LDBM 243/2005.  I will treat the Amended Notice of Opposition filed in LDBM 243/2005 as the Notice of Opposition to Ms Tang\u2019s claims in LDBM 309/2005 in addition to being the Notice of Opposition to Mr Lung and Ms Lee\u2019s claims in LDBM 243/2005. Issues 12. The parties have made some concessions at the trial.  Thus, not all the issues raised in the pleadings are relied upon.  Now, Mr Lung and Ms Lee\u2019s case is that :- (1) Ms Tang is in breach of Clause 17 of the DMC by continuing to park her van on the passageway protruding the boundary of CP25 and hence unreasonably obstructs Mr Lung and Ms Lee\u2019s right of access to and from CP27. (2) The IO has breached Section 18 (1)(c) of the Building Management Ordinance (\u201cthe BMO\u201d) by failing to do all such things reasonably necessary to enforce the obligations contained in the DMC, in particular, to prevent any obstruction and/or occupation of any of the common parts of the Building. (3) The IO has breached Clause 21(i) of the DMC by failing to prevent Ms Tang from obstructing the passageway, a common part of the Building. (4) The IO has breached Clause 21(l) of the DMC by failing to prevent Ms Tang from occupying any of the common parts or spaces of the Building. 13. Ms Tang\u2019s case is that:- (1) If her way of parking obstructs Mr Lung and Ms Lee\u2019s right of access to and from CP27, it is due to the mistake of the IO, in particular, the re-marking of CP25 in 1995.  The re-marking of CP25 was not in accordance with the Lower Carport Plan annexed to the DMC.  She has lodged complaints to the IO but has not received any constructive response from the IO. (2) Further or alternatively, even if the IO\u2019s re-marking of CP25 was in accordance with the Lower Carport Plan annexed to the DMC, the Wall was built upon a substantial part of CP25, trespassing her property.  It was therefore the IO who has breached the conditions of the DMC. 14. The IO\u2019s case is that :- (1) The IO has on many occasions requested Ms Tang not to cause obstruction to the passageway.  The IO has suggested to Ms Tang to park her van in CP25 in a tilted direction to avoid causing obstruction to and from the access of CP27.  The proposal was not accepted by Ms Tang. (2) The IO has made arrangements for Mr Lung and Ms Lee by permitting their tenant to park his car in another parking space in the Lower Carport of the Building on a temporary basis. (3) The IO has therefore taken all reasonable courses of action to resolve the matter and to attempt to prevent the obstruction of the passageway by Ms Tang. Ms Tang\u2019s breach 15. Clause 17 of the DMC stipulates that:- \u201cEach of the parties hereto shall not use or cause or suffer or permit to be used the flat or space of which he is entitled to the exclusive use, occupation and enjoyment or any part thereof for any illegal, unlawful or immoral purpose and shall not do or cause or suffer or permit to be done anything therein or thereupon which may create unnecessary noise or which may be or which may be or become a nuisance, annoyance or inconvenience to the occupiers of the other parts of the said building or of the premises in the neighborhood.\u201d 16. I do not think that Clause 17 is applicable to this case.  It concerns with the use of the space of which the owner in question \u201cis entitled to the exclusive use, occupation and enjoyment\u201d or anything done \u201ctherein or thereupon\u201d which may become a nuisance, annoyance or inconvenience to other occupiers.  However, what is objectionable in this case is just the protruding part of the van parked at CP25.  The use of CP25 within its boundary does not cause any nuisance, annoyance or inconvenience to Mr Lung or Ms Lee.  The protruding part, however, is on the common part of the Building, not a space of which Ms Tang is entitled to the exclusive use, occupation and enjoyment.  Ms Tang may be criticized for occupying the common part of the Building, but that is not the same as creating nuisance, annoyance or inconvenience within the boundary of CP25.  Thus, I do not find that Ms Tang is in breach of Clause 17 of the DMC. 17. As to the occupation of the common part of the Building, Mr Lung and Ms Lee have no right to take action against Ms Tang because the right belongs to the IO by the operation of Section 16 of the BMO, which stipulates that:- \u201cWhen the owners of a building have been incorporated \u2026 the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the owners in relation to the common parts of the building shall be exercised and performed by \u2026 the corporation to the exclusion of the owners \u2026\u201d 18. Thus, Mr Lung and Ms Lee\u2019s claims against Ms Tang cannot be established at all. The IO\u2019s breach 19. Not only that the IO has a right to take action against Ms Tang in respect of the common parts that she occupies, the IO has in fact a duty to enforce the obligations contained in the DMC by virtue of Section 18(1)(c) of the BMO, which provides that:- \u201cThe corporation shall \u2026 do all things reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the obligations contained in the deed of mutual covenant (if any) for the control, management and administration of the building.\u201d 20. Clauses 21(i) and (l) of the DMC impose the following duties on the IO:- \u201c(i) To prevent obstruction of any of the common parts of the said premises and any unnecessary obstruction of the private roadway.\u201d \u201c(l) To prevent any person occupying any of the common parts or spaces of or in the said premises or the said Building.\u201d 21. Thus, it is clear that the IO has a duty to clear the passageway between CO25 and CP27.  From the evidence and having the benefit of site inspection, I have no doubt that the protruding part of Ms Tang\u2019s van is blocking Mr Lung and Ms Lee\u2019s car from going in and out of CP27.  The IO should have taken actions to clear this blockage for Mr Lung and Ms Lee. 22. However, the IO contends that they have already taken all reasonable courses of action to resolve the matter and to attempt to prevent the obstruction of the passageway by Ms Tang.  The actions taken by the IO were that they had on many occasions requested Ms Tang not to cause obstruction to the passageway, suggested to Ms Tang to park her vehicle in CP25 in a tilted direction to avoid causing obstruction to and from the access of CP27, which was not accepted by Ms Tang, and made arrangement with Mr Lung and Ms Lee to permit their tenant to park his car in another parking space in the Lower Carport of the Building on a temporary basis. 23. I do not consider that these measures were sufficient for the IO to say that they have performed their duties under the DMC.  I agree that the IO\u2019s duties under the DMC and the BMO are not absolute.  What they are required to do is just to take any steps \u201creasonably necessary\u201d in the circumstances (see Section 18(1)(c) and The Incorporated Owners of King\u2019s Court, Consort Rise v. Gunning , LDBM 104/2004 & 115/2005).  However, what they have done so far are just temporary measures which cannot resolve the disputes permanently.  It is not right for Mr Lung and Ms Lee or their tenants to park their cars at another parking space permanently.  They have the right to use CP27.  Likewise, Ms Tang has her right to use CP25 to park her van within the boundary.  She is prevented to do so simply because of the Wall that was built upon CP25.  Parking at a tilted direction is just a temporary measure.  In fact, during the site inspection, I could observe that Ms Tang has genuine difficulty in parking her van at a tilted direction as directed.  It would be impracticable and unfair to Ms Tang to require her to park her van at the suggested tilted direction everyday. 24. There is a factual dispute about whether there were a few days in the past when Ms Tang was asked to park her van at a tilted direction towards CP27 there was no blockage to the passageway for CP27.  Ms Tang alleges that at that time she was told to park her van at a tilted direction towards Car Park No. 24 rather CP27, but she received complaints from the owner of Car Park 24 and hence she stopped doing it again.  In this regard, I believe that Mr Lee Chi Kwok, the then secretary of the IO, had asked Ms Tang to park her van in a tilted direction towards CP27 and not the opposite direction.  However, I do not consider this fact material.  As aforesaid, I find that Ms Tang had genuine difficulty in parking her van in such a position.  It is impracticable and unfair to her if she is required to go through this difficult task everyday, after all she has the right to use CP25 with its full size and with the Wall removed. 25. Thus, the ultimate question is whether the IO should remove the Wall.  In my view, it is reasonably necessary for the IO to remove the Wall because once the Wall is removed, all the problems caused to Mr Lung, Ms Lee and Ms Tang will be resolved permanently. 26. Nevertheless, the IO contends that they are not liable to remove the Wall, the Wall is not an illegal structure and that it would not be safe to remove it as it might affect the structure of the Building.  I accept that from the evidence available, it is more likely than not that the Wall was built by the Developer.  Although the IO concedes that the Wall is a common part of the Building, they argue that they would not immediately upon incorporation commit an act of trespass simply by operation of law (Section 16 of the BMO), even when the Developer might have committed an act of trespass on CP25.  In this regard, I totally agree with Mr Poon, counsel for Ms Tang, that even though the construction of the Wall was a tort of the Developer, there is a separate tort of \u201ccontinuing trespass\u201d on the part of the IO in allowing the Wall to remain on CP25 (see paragraphs 19-32 of Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 19 th ed.). 27. Relying on Hang Yick Properties Management Ltd. v. Incorporated Owners of Tuen Mun Kar Wah Building [2005] 2 HKLRD 499 , the IO argues that they would not be liable for such tortuous act being committed by only one of the co-owners, i.e. the Developer, before the IO\u2019s incorporation.  I disagree with this contention.  The Developer must have been the only owner of the land in question at the initial stage when the Building was built.  The Developer at that stage was equivalent to all the owners of the Building.  Thus, the IO will be responsible for the Developer\u2019s act by virtue of Section 16 of the BMO. 28. I have no doubt that the Wall is an illegal structure, as it is not referred to in the Approved Plan.  The fact that the Buildings Department did not take any action for its removal does not make the Wall legal.  At the highest, it could only mean that the Buildings Department has tolerated the existence of the Wall, but it is still an illegal structure. 29. I do not consider safety is an issue at all.  The IO can always engage experts to submit plans for the removal of the Wall to the Buildings Department for approval and remove the Wall with all the professional safety measures in place to prevent any possibility of collapse during the removal.  After removal, there can be other structures built around the area of CP25, if necessary, to ensure that the Building is as safe as before, but allowing CP25 to be used with its full size unblocked.  The cost involved in these works could be substantial, but it should not be a factor to allow the trespass on CP25 to continue. 30. Thus, I find that the IO is in breach of their duties under Clauses 21(i) and (l) of the DMC and Section 18(1)(c) of the BMO in not removing the Wall when it is reasonably necessary to do so to resolve the disputes in the occupation of the passageway between CP25 and CP27. Reliefs 31. By reasons aforesaid, I am prepared to grant a mandatory injunction requiring the IO to remove the Wall.  As the works involved will take some time to complete, I will give the IO 9 months to comply with the mandatory injunction. 32. However, I do not think that the other reliefs required by Mr Lung , Ms Lee and Ms Tang are necessary.  In particular, I do not agree that they have suffered the damages claimed by them.  There was another car parking space offered to Mr Lung and Ms Lee, which can substitute CP27 temporarily.  Although it is not a permanent solution, it can still eliminate all the alleged loss claimed by Mr Lung and Ms Lee.  I do not find that this alternative car parking space is in any way inferior to CP27.  Thus, it is unreasonable for Mr Lung and Ms Lee not to mitigate their losses by taking up this offer.  I also do not consider Ms Tang has suffered any damages or loss in value of her property.  She has been using CP25 together with the common area adjacent to CP25 all along.  So it is not a case that she has been deprived of a car park.  When the Wall is removed, she will be able to use CP25 with its full size.  There should not be any diminution of the value of her property. Orders 33. Thus, I order as follows:- (1)     In both LDBM 243/2005 and LDBM 309/2005, I order that the IO do within 9 months from the date of this order remove the part of the Wall that is situated within the boundary of CP25 as stipulated in the Approved Plan so that it will not cause any blockage to the use of CP25. (2)     All the other reliefs, save as to costs, claimed in both cases are refused. (3)     Costs orders nisi:  In LDBM 243/2005, Mr Lung and Ms Lee do pay Ms Tang her costs in respect of their claims against her, including counsel\u2019s certificate, to be taxed on High Court Scale, if not agreed.  In LDBM 243/2005, the IO do pay Mr Lung and Ms Lee their costs in respect of their claims against the IO, including counsel\u2019s certificate, to be taxed on High Court Scale if not agreed.  In both LDBM 243/2005 and LDBM 309/2005, the IO do pay Ms Tang her costs in respect of her claims against the IO, including counsel\u2019s certificate, to be taxed on High Court Scale if not agreed.  The aforesaid costs orders nisi shall become absolute if there is no further application on costs within 14 days from today. H.H.

The 1 st and 2 nd Applicants in LDBM 243/2005, namely Mr Lung Po Kwan (\u201cMr Lung\u201d) and Ms Lee Karen Yuk Lun (\u201cMs Lee\u201d) are the registered owners of Car Park No. 27 (\u201cCP27\u201d) on the Lower Carport, Y.Y. Mansion (\u201cthe Building\u201d), 96 Pok Fu Lam Road, Hong Kong.  The 1 st Respondent in LDBM 243/2005, namely Ms Tang Kam Sheung (\u201cMs Tang\u201d) is the registered owner of Car Park No. 25 (\u201cCP25\u201d) on the Lower Carport of the Building.  The 2 nd Respondent in LDBM 243/2005, namely the Incorporated Owners of Y.Y. Mansion (\u201cthe IO\u201d), is the owners\u2019 corporation of the Building.  Ms Tang is also the Applicant in LDBM 305/2005 and the IO is the Respondent in LDBM 305/2005.  LDBM 243/2005 and LDBM 309/2005 are tried together as they involve the same material issue, namely the liability of Ms Tang and/or the IO in causing obstruction of the passageway to and from CP27 by vehicle parked at CP25. 2. There are not many factual issues in dispute in these 2 cases.  The Building was developed by Yue Yan Investment Company (\u201cthe Developer\u201d) and the occupation permit was issued on 26 January 1967.  The Building has 4 residential blocks, namely Blocks A, B, C and D, and 3 levels of car parks, namely the Lower Carport, the Middle Carport and the Upper Carport.  The IO was incorporated in 1971 and became the manager of the Building since then. 3. During the period from March 1995 to November 1995, the Building had a large-scale renovation.  One of the works involved was to re-align the boundaries of the car parks in the Building in accordance with the approved car parking lay out plan registered in the Land Registry (\u201cthe Approved Plan\u201d).  Before the renovation, the boundaries of the car parks were not marked according to the Approved Plan, and this was a clear breach of the terms of the government grant. 4. However, in re-aligning the boundaries of the car parks, the architect responsible for the renovation discovered that the existing wall at the rear part of the Lower Carport (\u201cthe Wall\u201d) was built in a position that cut across the rear portion of CP25, rendering about one third of the area of CP25 hidden behind the Wall.  The Wall is not shown in the Approved Plan but has been in existence since about 1968.  There is no evidence as to who built the Wall or when exactly it was built. 5. As a result of the re-alignment, the usable area of CP25 is reduced substantially and Ms Tang cannot park her van at CP25 without protruding the front of her van from the boundary of CP25. 6. Mr Lung and Ms Lee became the registered owners of CP27 in April 1997.  Since then, Mr Lung has difficulty in parking his car at CP27, which is adjacent to CP25, because Ms Tang\u2019s van is obstructing the passageway to and from CP27.  It is not disputed that the passageway is part of the common part of the Building. 7. After many attempts to resolve the dispute amicably, the parties failed to reach a solution acceptable to all of them.  Thus, the matter came to the Lands Tribunal for determination. 8. In LDBM 243/2005, Mr Lung and Ms Lee are claiming for an injunction against Ms Tang that she be restrained from parking a vehicle at CP25 in such a manner that obstructs the passageway to and from CP27, as well as damages for obstructing the exclusive right to peaceful and quiet enjoyment of CP27.  They also claim against the IO for an order that the IO do carry out such action as necessary in order to prevent Ms Tang from parking a vehicle at CP25 in such a manner that obstructs the passageway to and from CP27, as well as for damages in failing to do so. 9. In LDBM 309/2005, Ms Tang is claiming against the IO for an order that the IO do re-modify the boundary of CP25 so that it matches the size as reflected in the Approved Plan, and for damages to be assessed. 10. In addition, Ms Tang also seeks for the following reliefs in LDBM 243/2005 :- (a) a declaration that the IO is not entitled to trespass on CP25; (b) an injunction to restrain the IO from interfering with Ms Tang\u2019s possession, use and enjoyment of CP25; (c) a declaration that Ms Tang is not responsible for the obstructions (if any) caused to the passageway of CP27; (d) (i)   an order that the IO do re-mark the car parks within 6 months so that the length and width of CP25 resemble that as described in the Lower Carport Plan annexed to the Deed of Mutual Covenant of the Building (\u201cthe DMC\u201d); (d) (ii)   an order for the IO to remove all objects erected in the Lower Carport that would interfere with the reasonable use of the car park spaces including and surrounding CP25 and to reinstate a passageway of not less than 7 feet in width for the car park spaces within the Lower Carport; (e) a mandatory injunction for the IO to remove all objects erected on CP25 within 6 months; (f) damages in the sum of $1,442,000 being a sum representing the decrease in value of Ms Tang\u2019s property due to the IO\u2019s trespass; and (g) interests. 11. It is rather unusual for a respondent to make a claim against another respondent in the same action without taking out any Third Party Proceedings.  However, as Ms Tang has already made a claim against the IO in LDBM 309/2005, and these 2 cases are tried together, I will treat these additional claims as the other remedies sought by Ms Tang in LDBM 309/2005.  There is also no Notice of Opposition filed by the IO in LDBM 309/2005, but the IO has raised their defence to Ms Tang\u2019s claims in the Amended Notice of Opposition filed in LDBM 243/2005.  I will treat the Amended Notice of Opposition filed in LDBM 243/2005 as the Notice of Opposition to Ms Tang\u2019s claims in LDBM 309/2005 in addition to being the Notice of Opposition to Mr Lung and Ms Lee\u2019s claims in LDBM 243/2005. Issues 12. The parties have made some concessions at the trial.  Thus, not all the issues raised in the pleadings are relied upon.  Now, Mr Lung and Ms Lee\u2019s case is that :- (1) Ms Tang is in breach of Clause 17 of the DMC by continuing to park her van on the passageway protruding the boundary of CP25 and hence unreasonably obstructs Mr Lung and Ms Lee\u2019s right of access to and from CP27. (2) The IO has breached Section 18 (1)(c) of the Building Management Ordinance (\u201cthe BMO\u201d) by failing to do all such things reasonably necessary to enforce the obligations contained in the DMC, in particular, to prevent any obstruction and/or occupation of any of the common parts of the Building. (3) The IO has breached Clause 21(i) of the DMC by failing to prevent Ms Tang from obstructing the passageway, a common part of the Building. (4) The IO has breached Clause 21(l) of the DMC by failing to prevent Ms Tang from occupying any of the common parts or spaces of the Building. 13. Ms Tang\u2019s case is that:- (1) If her way of parking obstructs Mr Lung and Ms Lee\u2019s right of access to and from CP27, it is due to the mistake of the IO, in particular, the re-marking of CP25 in 1995.  The re-marking of CP25 was not in accordance with the Lower Carport Plan annexed to the DMC.  She has lodged complaints to the IO but has not received any constructive response from the IO. (2) Further or alternatively, even if the IO\u2019s re-marking of CP25 was in accordance with the Lower Carport Plan annexed to the DMC, the Wall was built upon a substantial part of CP25, trespassing her property.  It was therefore the IO who has breached the conditions of the DMC. 14. The IO\u2019s case is that :- (1) The IO has on many occasions requested Ms Tang not to cause obstruction to the passageway.  The IO has suggested to Ms Tang to park her van in CP25 in a tilted direction to avoid causing obstruction to and from the access of CP27.  The proposal was not accepted by Ms Tang. (2) The IO has made arrangements for Mr Lung and Ms Lee by permitting their tenant to park his car in another parking space in the Lower Carport of the Building on a temporary basis. (3) The IO has therefore taken all reasonable courses of action to resolve the matter and to attempt to prevent the obstruction of the passageway by Ms Tang. Ms Tang\u2019s breach 15. Clause 17 of the DMC stipulates that:- \u201cEach of the parties hereto shall not use or cause or suffer or permit to be used the flat or space of which he is entitled to the exclusive use, occupation and enjoyment or any part thereof for any illegal, unlawful or immoral purpose and shall not do or cause or suffer or permit to be done anything therein or thereupon which may create unnecessary noise or which may be or which may be or become a nuisance, annoyance or inconvenience to the occupiers of the other parts of the said building or of the premises in the neighborhood.\u201d 16. I do not think that Clause 17 is applicable to this case.  It concerns with the use of the space of which the owner in question \u201cis entitled to the exclusive use, occupation and enjoyment\u201d or anything done \u201ctherein or thereupon\u201d which may become a nuisance, annoyance or inconvenience to other occupiers.  However, what is objectionable in this case is just the protruding part of the van parked at CP25.  The use of CP25 within its boundary does not cause any nuisance, annoyance or inconvenience to Mr Lung or Ms Lee.  The protruding part, however, is on the common part of the Building, not a space of which Ms Tang is entitled to the exclusive use, occupation and enjoyment.  Ms Tang may be criticized for occupying the common part of the Building, but that is not the same as creating nuisance, annoyance or inconvenience within the boundary of CP25.  Thus, I do not find that Ms Tang is in breach of Clause 17 of the DMC. 17. As to the occupation of the common part of the Building, Mr Lung and Ms Lee have no right to take action against Ms Tang because the right belongs to the IO by the operation of Section 16 of the BMO, which stipulates that:- \u201cWhen the owners of a building have been incorporated \u2026 the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the owners in relation to the common parts of the building shall be exercised and performed by \u2026 the corporation to the exclusion of the owners \u2026\u201d 18. Thus, Mr Lung and Ms Lee\u2019s claims against Ms Tang cannot be established at all. The IO\u2019s breach 19. Not only that the IO has a right to take action against Ms Tang in respect of the common parts that she occupies, the IO has in fact a duty to enforce the obligations contained in the DMC by virtue of Section 18(1)(c) of the BMO, which provides that:- \u201cThe corporation shall \u2026 do all things reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the obligations contained in the deed of mutual covenant (if any) for the control, management and administration of the building.\u201d 20. Clauses 21(i) and (l) of the DMC impose the following duties on the IO:- \u201c(i) To prevent obstruction of any of the common parts of the said premises and any unnecessary obstruction of the private roadway.\u201d \u201c(l) To prevent any person occupying any of the common parts or spaces of or in the said premises or the said Building.\u201d 21. Thus, it is clear that the IO has a duty to clear the passageway between CO25 and CP27.  From the evidence and having the benefit of site inspection, I have no doubt that the protruding part of Ms Tang\u2019s van is blocking Mr Lung and Ms Lee\u2019s car from going in and out of CP27.  The IO should have taken actions to clear this blockage for Mr Lung and Ms Lee. 22. However, the IO contends that they have already taken all reasonable courses of action to resolve the matter and to attempt to prevent the obstruction of the passageway by Ms Tang.  The actions taken by the IO were that they had on many occasions requested Ms Tang not to cause obstruction to the passageway, suggested to Ms Tang to park her vehicle in CP25 in a tilted direction to avoid causing obstruction to and from the access of CP27, which was not accepted by Ms Tang, and made arrangement with Mr Lung and Ms Lee to permit their tenant to park his car in another parking space in the Lower Carport of the Building on a temporary basis. 23. I do not consider that these measures were sufficient for the IO to say that they have performed their duties under the DMC.  I agree that the IO\u2019s duties under the DMC and the BMO are not absolute.  What they are required to do is just to take any steps \u201creasonably necessary\u201d in the circumstances (see Section 18(1)(c) and The Incorporated Owners of King\u2019s Court, Consort Rise v. Gunning , LDBM 104/2004 & 115/2005).  However, what they have done so far are just temporary measures which cannot resolve the disputes permanently.  It is not right for Mr Lung and Ms Lee or their tenants to park their cars at another parking space permanently.  They have the right to use CP27.  Likewise, Ms Tang has her right to use CP25 to park her van within the boundary.  She is prevented to do so simply because of the Wall that was built upon CP25.  Parking at a tilted direction is just a temporary measure.  In fact, during the site inspection, I could observe that Ms Tang has genuine difficulty in parking her van at a tilted direction as directed.  It would be impracticable and unfair to Ms Tang to require her to park her van at the suggested tilted direction everyday. 24. There is a factual dispute about whether there were a few days in the past when Ms Tang was asked to park her van at a tilted direction towards CP27 there was no blockage to the passageway for CP27.  Ms Tang alleges that at that time she was told to park her van at a tilted direction towards Car Park No. 24 rather CP27, but she received complaints from the owner of Car Park 24 and hence she stopped doing it again.  In this regard, I believe that Mr Lee Chi Kwok, the then secretary of the IO, had asked Ms Tang to park her van in a tilted direction towards CP27 and not the opposite direction.  However, I do not consider this fact material.  As aforesaid, I find that Ms Tang had genuine difficulty in parking her van in such a position.  It is impracticable and unfair to her if she is required to go through this difficult task everyday, after all she has the right to use CP25 with its full size and with the Wall removed. 25. Thus, the ultimate question is whether the IO should remove the Wall.  In my view, it is reasonably necessary for the IO to remove the Wall because once the Wall is removed, all the problems caused to Mr Lung, Ms Lee and Ms Tang will be resolved permanently. 26. Nevertheless, the IO contends that they are not liable to remove the Wall, the Wall is not an illegal structure and that it would not be safe to remove it as it might affect the structure of the Building.  I accept that from the evidence available, it is more likely than not that the Wall was built by the Developer.  Although the IO concedes that the Wall is a common part of the Building, they argue that they would not immediately upon incorporation commit an act of trespass simply by operation of law (Section 16 of the BMO), even when the Developer might have committed an act of trespass on CP25.  In this regard, I totally agree with Mr Poon, counsel for Ms Tang, that even though the construction of the Wall was a tort of the Developer, there is a separate tort of \u201ccontinuing trespass\u201d on the part of the IO in allowing the Wall to remain on CP25 (see paragraphs 19-32 of Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 19 th ed.). 27. Relying on Hang Yick Properties Management Ltd. v. Incorporated Owners of Tuen Mun Kar Wah Building [2005] 2 HKLRD 499 , the IO argues that they would not be liable for such tortuous act being committed by only one of the co-owners, i.e. the Developer, before the IO\u2019s incorporation.  I disagree with this contention.  The Developer must have been the only owner of the land in question at the initial stage when the Building was built.  The Developer at that stage was equivalent to all the owners of the Building.  Thus, the IO will be responsible for the Developer\u2019s act by virtue of Section 16 of the BMO. 28. I have no doubt that the Wall is an illegal structure, as it is not referred to in the Approved Plan.  The fact that the Buildings Department did not take any action for its removal does not make the Wall legal.  At the highest, it could only mean that the Buildings Department has tolerated the existence of the Wall, but it is still an illegal structure. 29. I do not consider safety is an issue at all.  The IO can always engage experts to submit plans for the removal of the Wall to the Buildings Department for approval and remove the Wall with all the professional safety measures in place to prevent any possibility of collapse during the removal.  After removal, there can be other structures built around the area of CP25, if necessary, to ensure that the Building is as safe as before, but allowing CP25 to be used with its full size unblocked.  The cost involved in these works could be substantial, but it should not be a factor to allow the trespass on CP25 to continue. 30. Thus, I find that the IO is in breach of their duties under Clauses 21(i) and (l) of the DMC and Section 18(1)(c) of the BMO in not removing the Wall when it is reasonably necessary to do so to resolve the disputes in the occupation of the passageway between CP25 and CP27. Reliefs 31. By reasons aforesaid, I am prepared to grant a mandatory injunction requiring the IO to remove the Wall.  As the works involved will take some time to complete, I will give the IO 9 months to comply with the mandatory injunction. 32. However, I do not think that the other reliefs required by Mr Lung , Ms Lee and Ms Tang are necessary.  In particular, I do not agree that they have suffered the damages claimed by them.  There was another car parking space offered to Mr Lung and Ms Lee, which can substitute CP27 temporarily.  Although it is not a permanent solution, it can still eliminate all the alleged loss claimed by Mr Lung and Ms Lee.  I do not find that this alternative car parking space is in any way inferior to CP27.  Thus, it is unreasonable for Mr Lung and Ms Lee not to mitigate their losses by taking up this offer.  I also do not consider Ms Tang has suffered any damages or loss in value of her property.  She has been using CP25 together with the common area adjacent to CP25 all along.  So it is not a case that she has been deprived of a car park.  When the Wall is removed, she will be able to use CP25 with its full size.  There should not be any diminution of the value of her property. Orders 33. Thus, I order as follows:- (1)     In both LDBM 243/2005 and LDBM 309/2005, I order that the IO do within 9 months from the date of this order remove the part of the Wall that is situated within the boundary of CP25 as stipulated in the Approved Plan so that it will not cause any blockage to the use of CP25. (2)     All the other reliefs, save as to costs, claimed in both cases are refused. (3)     Costs orders nisi:  In LDBM 243/2005, Mr Lung and Ms Lee do pay Ms Tang her costs in respect of their claims against her, including counsel\u2019s certificate, to be taxed on High Court Scale, if not agreed.  In LDBM 243/2005, the IO do pay Mr Lung and Ms Lee their costs in respect of their claims against the IO, including counsel\u2019s certificate, to be taxed on High Court Scale if not agreed.  In both LDBM 243/2005 and LDBM 309/2005, the IO do pay Ms Tang her costs in respect of her claims against the IO, including counsel\u2019s certificate, to be taxed on High Court Scale if not agreed.  The aforesaid costs orders nisi shall become absolute if there is no further application on costs within 14 days from today. H.H.

DATE OF DELIVERY OF JUDGMENT: 27th May 1996.", "coram": "TRIBUNAL: His Honour Judge Wong, Presiding Officer.", "parties": "BETWEEN Madam Cheung Kit Mui Applicant and Bayview Mansion Management Committee of Incorporated Owners of Bayview Mansion Respondent TRIBUNAL: His Honour Judge Wong, Presiding Officer. DATE OF HEARING: 19th Apri1 1996. DATE OF DELIVERY OF JUDGMENT: 27th May 1996. JUDGMENT 1. Mr. Chan Wing Wai, the husband of Cheung Kit Mui, (owner of Flat B5 on 16/F of Bay View Mansion) applied for the following orders :- 1)  That the common area along the corridor of the 16/F blocked by the owner of  Flat B3 be restored to its original condition. 2)  That the Management Committee be ordered to take action to remove the iron gate which blocked the corridor and 3)  That the Management Committee be personally liable for charges involved. Facts 2. There is no dispute that the owner of Flat B3 erected an iron gate blocking off part of the corridor on the 16/F and had placed tables, pots and plants, buckets, broom and mops in the area enclosed. He produced 2 photographs taken an 10/1/96 depicting the enclosed area. Grounds of Opposition 3. The Respondents raised 2 grounds namely :- 1)  The Applicant has no locus standi as he is not the owner 2)  The iron gate was erected with the approval of the Incorporated Owners of Bayview Mansion Blocks A & B. Locus Standi 4. I agree with counsel for the Respondents that the applicant being the husband of the owner has no right to take action as he is not the owner of Flat B5. However he has been authorised by his wife (the owner) to conduct the proceedings on her behalf. This defect can be rectified by amending the name of the applicant to Cheung Kit Mui. Mr. Chan acting in person did not know the law. To avoid having to start another application I give leave to amend the name of the applicant to Cheung Kit Mui. There is no prejudice to the Respondents by the amendment. There is no necessity to amend the opposition nor could the Respondents be taken by surprise. I order reservice of the amended application be dispensed with. Power of the Incorporated Owners to approve such enclosure 5. The respective owners were assigned their flats subject to the Dead of Mutual Covenant (\"DMC\"). 6. Clause 2 of the DMC states \"Subject to Clause 11 hereof each of the parties hereto shall have the right in common with other lessees owners and all other persons authorised by them to use for the purpose of access to and agress from the premises in the said building so allotted to them the entrance hall staircases and landings and corridors in the said Building and such of the passages therein and in the open yard space (if any) as are not included in anyone of the other premises in the said Building.\" 7. Clause 14 (b) of the DMC states, \"Not to install make or maintain or cause to be installed made or maintained any gates doors grills or similar barriers to the entrances of his premises in the Building on the upper floors thereof without the prior approval in writing of the Owner of the Building Provided That such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld if such barriers are in the opinion of the Owner of the Building reasonably well designed and installed AND that if such prior approval of the Owner of the Building shall not have been obtained it shall have the right to remove or cause to be removed any such gates doors grills or similar barriers installed made or maintained at the costs and expenses of the Owner of the Flat or of the premises so concerned which shall be payable on demand PROVIDED FURTHER THAT the provisions of this sub-clause shall not apply to the premises in the said Building on the Ground Floor and the Basement thereof. \" 8. The minutes of the 13th Committee meeting in 1988 was produced. It was resolved, inter alia, that the owner of Flat B3 on 16/F could not place any object in the area enclosed and that action for the removal of the iron gate would be suspended. The Respondents also produced a copy letter addressed to the owner of Flat B3 on 16/F stating that she attended that meeting and asked for the demolition of the iron gate to be postponed and agreed to remove all the objects placed in the encroached area. 9. Counsel for the Respondents submitted that by clause 14(h) the owners can instal gates to the entrance of their premises with the approval of the Committee. He read from the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary the meaning of \"entrance\" and said that the iron gate which encroached that part of the corridor was erected at the entrance to Flat B3. With utmost respect to him an iron gate has been duly erected immediately in front of his premises immediately next to the wooden door which is the entrance to her premises. The extra iron gate which fenced off part of the corridor is not an iron gate installed at the entrance of her premises. That argument must fail. 10. In any event from the evidence produced there was no approval by the Committee. They had resolved that the execution for the removal be suspended on . her undertaking not to place any object in the encroached area. 11. Counsel further submitted that 80% of the owners had not objected to such encroachment. Respondents has submitted 154 signatures of owners/occupiers allegedly agreeing to the installation of the iron gate by the owner of Flat B3 on 16/F. 12. Clause 2 of the DMC clearly states that all owners have a right to use the entrance hall, staircases, landings and corridors. To block off a part of the corridor to the exclusion of the other owners is a clear breach of the DMC. In my judgment the Incorporated Owners have no power to give approval to anyone to have exclusive use of any common part. It is trite law that DMC can not be varied or amended except with the consent of all parties who take subject to the DMC. 13. It is the duty of the Committee of the Incorporated Owners to see to it that no one is in breach of the DMC. If anyone is in breach it is the Committee's duty to take action to put right that breach. COSTS 14. I am surprised that despite of having been advised by lawyer, the Committee has seen fit to contest and continue with this action which in my view is devoid of merits. 15. Anyone who has been properly advised should know that the encroachment is in clear breach of the DMC and the committee has a duty to put that right. Not only the Committee did not take action to have the iron grate removed the Committee has engaged solicitors and counsel to defend this action. In my view the costs for engaging lawyers to defend this action should be borne by the members of the Committee personally. The other owners should not be called upon to contribute to defend a hopeless case. 16. I am not in a position to know what sort of advice the Committee got from lawyer, if the Committee had been advised that there is merit in the defence that the Committee had power to approve the installation of that iron gate then clearly the Committee had been ill advised and the Committee members should get indemnity from those who gave the advice. CONCLUSION 17. For reasons above I order that the iron gate in question and all items stored or placed in the corridor be removed and that the common area be restored to its original state. An order nisi that save and except for the costs of obtaining advice as to merits the members of the Committee of the Incorporated Owners do bear their own costs and the costs of this action personally without contribution from the individual owners.
